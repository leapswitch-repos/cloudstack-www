It consists of two well-concerted components. LINSTOR and DRBD. Each of them also has its independent use cases, where it is deployed alone. In this presentation, the combination of these two is examined. They form the control plane and the data plane of the SDS. We will touch on: Performance, scalability, hyper-convergence (data-locality for high IO performance), resiliency through data replication (synchronous within a site, 2-way, 3-way, or more), snapshots, backup (to S3), encryption at rest, deduplication, compression, placement policies (regarding failure domains), management CLI and webGUI, monitoring interface, self-healing (restoring redundancy after device/node failure), the federation of multiple sites (async mirroring and repeatedly snapshot difference shipping), QoS control (noisy neighbors limitation) and of course: complete integration with CloudStack for KVM guests. It is Open Source software following the Unix philosophy. Each component solves one task, made for maximal re-usability. The solution leverages the Linux kernel, LVM and/or ZFS, and many Open Source software libraries. Building on these giant Open Source foundations, not only saves LINBIT from re-inventing the wheels, it also empowers your day 2 operation teams since they are already familiar with these technologies.</div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEWjocVhzno&amp;list=PLnIKk7GjgFlYcKNbhYSgWGbJ8nJ0g496V&amp;index=22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/3a720046-c093-4636-83bb-e48f4f64da92" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 11.41.03.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/a81uXODtt3KItT" width="854" height="712" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> </iframe><div><strong>About Phillip Reisner:</strong></div><div>Philipp Reisner is one of the founders and CEO of LINBIT in Vienna/Austria.

With the help of Stack Console’s reseller management module and CloudStack, a data center or cloud service provider can build resellers/partners and provide them with an automated white-label cloud management platform so they can sell cloud services under their own brand, such as compute, Kubernetes, load balancer, block storage, and so on. Many of resellers are likely to be small and medium-sized businesses that want to get into the cloud market, so this is great news for them. Service providers will still make money whether a customer buys a service directly from them or through one of their resellers.</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_nhzY3-QZs&amp;list=PLnIKk7GjgFlYcKNbhYSgWGbJ8nJ0g496V&amp;index=24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6b18b8d7-3faf-4f2d-87cc-2ea5686f305e" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 11.46.25.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/hLfHYS9nzHSnt9" width="854" height="712" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> </iframe><div><strong>About Saurabh Rapatwar:</strong></div><div>Saurabh is a leader, an innovator, and a technology pioneer with more than 13 years of experience in the SaaS, IaaS, and technology domains.

SAML 2.0 authentication Service Provider plugin which is found to be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection. This plugin is not enabled by default and the attacker would require that this plugin be enabled to exploit the vulnerability. When the SAML 2.0 plugin is enabled in affected versions of Apache CloudStack could potentially allow the exploitation of XXE vulnerabilities. The SAML 2.0 messages constructed during the authentication flow in Apache CloudStack are XML-based and the XML data is parsed by various standard libraries that are now understood to be vulnerable to XXE injection attacks such as arbitrary file reading, possible denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF) on the CloudStack management server.</p><p>As of 18th July 2022, this is now tracked under CVE-2022-35741: <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35741</a></p><p>To mitigate the risk, a CloudStack admin can do any of the following:</p><p>1. Disable the SAML 2.0 plugin by setting `saml2.enabled` to false and restart the management servers.</p><p>2. Upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.16.1.1 or 4.17.0.1 or higher.</p><p><b>Credit</b>This issue was discovered and reported by &quot;v3ged0ge&quot;.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/announcement">announcement</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/meet-the-community-k-b">Meet the Community - K B Shiv Kumar </a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-06-20T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 20, 2022</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/c0ca3334-ec0f-4dc4-80a3-b97372f44973"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/c0ca3334-ec0f-4dc4-80a3-b97372f44973" alt="Screenshot 2022-06-21 at 10.35.49.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p><strong>Introduce yourself with a few words</strong></p><p>I am K B Shiv Kumar and am the Co-Founder and CTO at IndiQus. I am based out of Delhi, India and am passionate about travelling and dig going on driving holidays with my friends and family. I love listening to music and ABBA has been my all-time favourite band since childhood.</p><p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet?</strong></p><p>As a commerce graduate, moving to an IT career accidentally was probably the best thing that happened to me. I subsequently completed my masters in software engineering and worked as a developer with different ISPs where my interest in infrastructure programming was kindled.</p><p><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>My first exposure to CloudStack was in 2013 and since then I have embarked on a very exciting journey where I have evolved from a CloudStack user to an evangelist. I love tinkering on CloudStack and the techno-commercial possibilities it offers to the regional Internet, Cloud and Data Center providers.</p><p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>I have received a lot of help from the community. If I must take a single name, it would be Rohit Yadav. He has been my mentor and will probably remain so for a while as far as CloudStack is concerned. During my initial days, folks from Citrix helped me a lot too, Vimmy Hong for one.</p><p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong></p><p>My commitment to CloudStack has been indirect but impacting. It has been taking it to the industry - the enterprises, telecoms, ISPs and data centre providers and showcasing how CloudStack can be leveraged as a viable cloud business model and implementing the same across various geographies. My organisation’s product offering is completely architected by leveraging CloudStack and transforming it into a techno-commercial solution.</p><p>On the technical side, I have worked extensively on various aspects of monitoring CloudStack and shared the same amongst the community. I am currently looking to implement an outside-in way of monitoring VRs and providing auto-scale facilities without modifying the CloudStack code.</p><p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong></p><p>It’s cost-effective, allows unmatched customising flexibility and it works!

This issue affects the creation and the usage of existing Shared Mount Point storage pools on Apache CloudStack 4.17.0.0.<br></p><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17.0.0 added support for the StorPool storage based on Shared Mount Point. However, the current version of CloudStack doesn<!-- -->&#x27;<!-- -->t allow multiple implementations of Shared Mount Point storage pool providers, causing the StorPool provider to override the default implementation. This affected the other storage pool providers for Shared Mount Point since CloudStack tries to add them as a StorPool storage pool.<br></p><p>To mitigate the issue, a CloudStack administrator needs to do the following on version 4.17.0.0:<br></p><ul><li>On each management server: stop the CloudStack management service, remove the Storpool plugin jar on /usr/share/cloudstack-management/lib/cloud-plugin-storage-volume-storpool-4.17.0.0.jar and restart the Cloudstack management service<br></li><li>On each KVM host: stop the CloudStack agent service, remove the StorPool plugin jar on /usr/share/cloudstack-agent/lib/cloud-plugin-storage-volume-storpool-4.17.0.0.jar and restart the CloudStack agent service<br></li></ul><p>Note: This workaround removes the StorPool plugin support.

Apache CloudStack 4.17 is an LTS (Long Term Support) release so will be maintained for a period of 18 months after release.</p><p>As always, the release contains a myriad of small improvements and bug fixes but here we focus on the major new functionality of the release.</p><p><strong>VR Zero Downtime upgrades and Live Patching</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/bc49a766-6b83-4e9c-b4f9-a233a176699f"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/bc49a766-6b83-4e9c-b4f9-a233a176699f" alt="0.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>This is one of the most anticipated improvements by existing Apache CloudStack operators. CloudStack has always been easier to upgrade than many of its competitors but has required its virtual routers to be redeployed during an upgrade.</p><p><strong>o Zero Downtime Upgrades for Virtual Routers</strong><br>With this new feature, the virtual router does not have to go through the process of complete removal and instantiating a new one involving shutdown, resource release, system VM template copy from secondary storage to primary, starting and VR configuration<br>Previously when a new release of Apache CloudStack was deployed, the operations team had to organize maintenance windows to allow the redeployment of every virtual router. Now an in-place upgrade of CloudStack virtual routers can be performed with zero downtime.<br></p><p><strong>o VR Live Patching</strong><br>Underpinning zero downtime upgrades is the new feature VR live patching. This feature can also be used independently of upgrades and allow CloudStack admins to apply software updates to Virtual Routers on the fly. Previously all Apache CloudStack scripts to manage the Virtual Router were stored in an ISO image and mounted during the first boot and then copied to the Virtual Router. Now the update is performed dynamically , as long as the base OS remains constant , users to not need to recreate the Virtual Router.</p><p><strong>IPv6 support for Isolated and VPC Networks</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/919e55f8-b723-4680-b538-f9afc2ce0e01"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/919e55f8-b723-4680-b538-f9afc2ce0e01" alt="2.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>IPv6 is considered a natural evolution of any system that intends to be present in computing environments in the future. The RIPE NCC, which assigns IP addresses in 76 countries to ISPs and other organizations, got its final allocation of IPv4 addresses from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in 2012.<br>Apache CloudStack already supported IPv6 for Shared Networks; now IPv6 is also supported for Isolated Networks and VPC. Users can deploy IPv6 networks where routing is currently static, allowing users to use subnets of IPv6 networks directly in CloudStack instances.<br>In this context, unlike IPv4 that relies on NAT to deliver network services to users, the Virtual Router behaves like a real router, routing IPv6 packets and allowing users to configure firewall.</p><p><strong>StorPool Storage Plugin</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/c15f95e5-3b77-4bc5-b518-dc42ca867041"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/c15f95e5-3b77-4bc5-b518-dc42ca867041" alt="3.png" width="710" height="456" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>StorPool is a software defined storage platform in use by many CloudStack operators globally. StorPool has had “managed storage” integration with CloudStack for some time but now the StorPool Storage plug-in is natively included with Apache CloudStack. Thanks to the built-in automation of the plug-in, cloud builders can seamlessly manage their cloud from CloudStack’s familiar user interfaces, and all storage-related operations are transparently passed down to the underlying StorPool primary storage system.</p><p>With the Storpool plug-in, the features available in StorPool get inherited by each cloud-deployed - enabling cloned provisioning, instant snapshots, thin provisioning, backup/DR and QoS policies per virtual disk and/or per Instance. Instance provisioning is nearly instantaneous and data placement policies and other settings can be changed in-flight to address changes in user requirements.</p><p><strong>Self-service Network Improvements</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/417bd9d1-ba39-4904-b56b-bcf226dab4ff"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/417bd9d1-ba39-4904-b56b-bcf226dab4ff" alt="4.png" width="668" height="575" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Previously, the creation of Shared Networks and Private Gateways was an admin- only feature. When a user needed a Shared Network or Private Gateway, they would have to make a service request to the Service Provider or infrastructure operations team. Only after that, users could configure and use their respective resources.</p><p>With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can self-serve the creation of these resources through the UI or API with no involvement of the admin.</p><p><strong>Multi-account Network Access</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/6c540c73-9951-4cb7-8a4c-7fdf1b25a000"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6c540c73-9951-4cb7-8a4c-7fdf1b25a000" alt="5.png" width="750" height="242" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>In Apache CloudStack, users are organized into a logical structure of Accounts and Domains. In previous version of Apache CloudStack, the resources of each Account weren’t shared, and each Account had its own resources. As an example, sometimes​​​​​​ a particular software application from a specific Account needed to access an application in another account under the same Domain. For this to be feasible, users configured their networks with the firewall rules, port forwarding, load balancing or private gateway to allow this type of use case. In addition, this configuration caused a lot of network overhead as all packets had to go through 2 different Virtual Routers to reach their destination.</p><p>With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can connect their instances by adding a new network interface from an Account under the same Domain, simplifying this kind of use case. Furthermore, if the communication between instances occurs only at OSI layer 2, several overheads are removed, considering that the I/O packets will be established between the instances directly in the same network layer to which they are connected.</p><p><strong>Multiple SSH Keys</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/6242bd8e-d5ad-4027-aed4-3dd576a58199"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6242bd8e-d5ad-4027-aed4-3dd576a58199" alt="6.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>CloudStack users can now create Instances and include multiple SSH Keys. This avoids the need to share private keys between users that access the Instance.</p><p>Previously, if users needed to add more SSH Keys to access the instance, it was necessary to connect to the instance and then edit the .ssh/authorized_keys file, however now all the keys needed can be selected during the instance creation itself.</p><p><strong>Structured System Events</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/69265134-a914-48d2-8af0-70cb5d8d0828"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/69265134-a914-48d2-8af0-70cb5d8d0828" alt="Untitled design.png" width="750" height="647" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 brings much more structure to its system Events. Auditability and traceability of operations performed are important requirements for most organisations.</p><p>CloudStack Events are the primary data-source for auditing and troubleshooting a CloudStack environment. Events have now been improved by being explicitly linking to the resource that the event concerns. This allows Events to be searched, filtered and sorted by object.</p><p>Navigation is also improved, allowing users to navigate easily to the events for a specific object i.e. Instance, Network, Host</p><p>Many CloudStack operators had previously parsed the Event messages to store them in a 3rd party data source. The messages remain unchanged to allow backwards compatibility of such integrations.</p><p><strong>Snapshot improvements</strong></p><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 introduces storage-based snapshots - an alternative for taking snapshots of virtual machines running under the KVM hypervisor. The current implementation uses libvirt to perform the snapshot and doesn’t allow storage providers that keep VM virtual disks in RAW format (e.g., Ceph/NetApp SolidFire/LINSTOR/StorPool Storage) to take VM snapshots.</p><p>The storage-based snapshots feature provides for such storage systems the functionality to take crash-consistent snapshots of any VM’s virtual disks without the memory. The feature relies on each underlying storage plug-in’s capability to create/revert/delete virtual disk snapshots.</p><p><strong>Instance and Volumes migration improvements</strong></p><p>Apache CloudStack allows admins to migrate Instances and volumes using a wizard. Previously this wizard would automatically allocate Primary Storage for Instance Volumes based solely on storage tags. CloudStack 4.17 now allows the admin to explicitly allocate each Instance Volume to different specific Primary Storages.</p><p>In addition, to make more informed decisions while selecting destination host and storage, additional information is presented in the UI such as the occupancy of existing capacity of these resources, which brings a significant improvement in migration functionality.</p><p><strong>More flexible service offerings</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/7d34a18b-a0d9-4da5-8ffe-bfb66496aaf3"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/7d34a18b-a0d9-4da5-8ffe-bfb66496aaf3" alt="9.png" width="750" height="596" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 redefines the relationship between the Service Offerings used for Instance Root Disks and the Service Offering for the Instance itself.</p><p>Instance Root Volumes were previously handled decoupled from Disk Offerings: a change of the Root Volume characteristics wasn’t possible due to this logical disconnection. Thus, users couldn’t, for example, change to a Disk Offering that guaranteed higher I/O needs if necessary. So, there were two types of resources, Root volume and Data volume, but the treatment used in both was not unified.</p><p>The existing model is still fully supported if required, but this improvement gives operators far greater flexibility when it comes to the provisioning and billing for root volumes.</p><p><strong>Server Status Report</strong>Apache CloudStack 4.17 now gives admins the ability to see the status/health of their Management Servers, the Usage Server, and the underlying database server (and their respective individual components). This feature is available in the UI and API for integration/monitoring purposes.</p><p><strong>KVM multiple local storage</strong></p><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 now supports multiple local storage volumes for KVM based Hosts. Previously, for KVM hosts, it was only possible to have one primary local storage, which prevented providers from adding extra disks to be offered on CloudStack.</p><p>With this improvement, if more than one local disk on the KVM host is available, it is possible to designate them to be offered as a local disk offering , thus enabling a better use of allocated resources.</p><p><strong>Reserve and release Public IPs</strong>Users can now reserve public IPs for later use on their networks. This new functionality makes managing this feature easier, as users often need to have IP information available beforehand to parameterize DNS records, for example.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/announcement">announcement</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2022-november">CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2022 - November 14-16</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-26T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 26, 2022</time></div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/Ivet_H_Petrova" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1331984193392435200/djCqv-vM_400x400.jpg" alt="Ivet Petrova"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/Ivet_H_Petrova" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ivet Petrova</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">PMC Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/c8eec338-5d20-4e46-80d3-376294e441f0"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/c8eec338-5d20-4e46-80d3-376294e441f0" alt="Screenshot 2022-05-26 at 15.49.12.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>For the 10<sup>th</sup> consecutive year, the Apache CloudStack community is organising its major event - CloudStack Collaboration Conference, running from 14<sup>th</sup> to 16<sup>th</sup> November 2022.
