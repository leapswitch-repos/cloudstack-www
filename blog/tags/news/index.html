native communities. It has been a fantastic opportunity for us to represent our
technology on the global stage, and meet engineers, DevOps and infrastructure
experts. Community members have had the pleasure of running attendees through
multiple CloudStack demos and answering their many questions about the
open-source cloud management solution. We also had the opportunity to share the
pitfalls, hacks, learnings, and key takeaways from

the best infrastructure for running containers at scale while maintaining
investments in infrastructure low.</p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/bf09db74-8261-4f1d-9001-d1d7b4f1cf23" class="img_ev3q"><h3>Explore the Kubernetes Cluster API Provider for Apache CloudStack</h3><p>The Kubernetes Cluster API (CAPI) provider for Apache CloudStack allows
Kubernetes users to build and manage resources on Apache CloudStack. The
provider is available under the Apache 2 open-source license and is managed by
the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). The Cluster API brings
declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and
management. The API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing
for true Apache CloudStack hybrid deployments of Kubernetes. It is built atop
the lessons learned from previous cluster managers such as kops and kubicorn.</p><h3>Discover the Upcoming CloudStack Events</h3><p><strong>CloudStack European User Group</strong>: The next event that the Apache CloudStack
community is hosting is the CloudStack European User Group, taking place on <strong>4th
May</strong> in the Gandhi Room at Cifas, Tavistock Square, 7-12 Lynton House, <strong>London</strong>,

solutions.</p><h2>Why Choose Apache CloudStack If You Are A Cloud Builder</h2><p>A problem that many businesses face when entering the public cloud market is
finding the suitable software and partners which enable a rapid deployment for
their customers. Often, it takes up a significant number of resources and can
have a negative financial impact on the company if the wrong decision is made.</p><p>CloudStack is a turnkey solution for cloud builders and manages service
providers. It is completely open-source, easy to implement, manage and scale.
Powered by a large open-source community and following rapid release cycles,
Apache CloudStack help cloud builders solve their key challenges – costs, vendor
lock-in and using fewer resources to manage tens of thousands of physical
servers installed in geographically distributed data centers.</p><h2>Why Attend CloudFest</h2><p>Whether you are still open to attending the last day of CloudFest tomorrow, or

We collaborated on a successful major release - Apache CloudStack 4.17 bringing a bunch of new capabilities and improvements, as well as created multiple new CloudStack integrations. As well as this, the community created two minor releases as part of the LTS programme.</p><p>The community also held two successful conferences, one of which being the first in-person CloudStack Collaboration Conference since the pandemic. The new &amp;&quot;Year in Review&quot; blogs series encourages us to reflect on the community<!-- -->’<!-- -->s achievements, and thus lets us brainstorm the ways we will further develop Apache CloudStack in all facets in the new year. Find out what we managed to achieve together and what is coming in 2023 in this recap article!</p><span><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/what-s-new-in-apache1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><span>Apache CloudStack 4.17 Release</span></strong></a></span><p>The year saw the newest major release - Apache CloudStack 4.17, which brought a number of new and exciting features being introduced, including:</p><ul><li><span><span><strong><span>Zero Downtime Upgrades for Virtual Routers</span></strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>With this new feature, the virtual router does not have to go through the process of complete removal and instantiating a new one involving shutdown, resource release, system VM template copy from secondary storage to primary, starting and VR configuration</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Previously when a new release of Apache CloudStack was deployed, the operations team had to organize maintenance windows to allow the redeployment of every virtual router. Now an in-place upgrade of CloudStack virtual routers can be performed with zero downtime.</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong><span>VR Live Patching</span></strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>Underpinning zero downtime upgrades is the new feature VR live patching. This feature can also be used independently of upgrades and allow CloudStack admins to apply software updates to Virtual Routers on the fly. Previously all Apache CloudStack scripts to manage the Virtual Router were stored in an ISO image and mounted during the first boot and then copied to the Virtual Router. Now the update is performed dynamically , as long as the base OS remains constant , users to not need to recreate the Virtual Router.</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><strong><span><span>IPv6 support for Isolated and VPC Networks</span></span></strong></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>IPv6 is considered a natural evolution of any system that intends to be present in computing environments in the future. The RIPE NCC, which assigns IP addresses in 76 countries to ISPs and other organizations, got its final allocation of IPv4 addresses from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in 2012.</span></span></span><br><span><span><span>Apache CloudStack already supported IPv6 for Shared Networks; now IPv6 is also supported for Isolated Networks and VPC. Users can deploy IPv6 networks where routing is currently static, allowing users to use subnets of IPv6 networks directly in CloudStack instances.</span><br><span>In this context, unlike IPv4 that relies on NAT to deliver network services to users, the Virtual Router behaves like a real router, routing IPv6 packets and allowing users to configure firewall.</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><strong><span><span>Self-service Network Improvements</span></span></strong></span></li></ul><p><span><span>Previously, the creation of Shared Networks and Private Gateways was an admin- only feature. When a user needed a Shared Network or Private Gateway, they would have to make a service request to the Service Provider or infrastructure operations team. Only after that, users could configure and use their respective resources.</span></span></p><p><span><span>With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can self-serve the creation of these resources through the UI or API with no involvement of the admin.</span></span></p><p><strong><span><span>To learn more about the remaining features introduced in the 4.17 release, read the </span><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/what-s-new-in-apache1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>release blog.</span></a></span></strong></p><p><strong><span><u><span><span>New CloudStack Integrations</span></span></u></span></strong></p><p><span><span>The community has collaborated on a new blog series named ‘CloudStack Integrations’, introducing a range of technologies with which CloudStack is integrated with and can become part of your technology stack.

The Cluster API brings declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and management. The API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing for true Apache CloudStack hybrid deployments of Kubernetes.

With the integration, the features available in StorPool get inherited by each cloud deployed with StorPool Storage - enabling cloned provisioning, instant snapshots, thin provisioning, and backup, disaster recovery, and Quality of Service (QoS) policies per virtual disk or virtual machine (VM). Thanks to the way StorPool works, VM provisioning is nearly instantaneous, and data placement policies and other settings can be changed in-flight to address changes in user requirements. </span><a href="/img/imported/5e069f87-a428-4f07-92ac-a8bf8d0d114b?api=v2">Click here</a><span> to download the solution brief. </span></span></p><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2022-roundup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><span>CloudStack Collaboration Conference</span></strong></a><p><span><span>The community re-joined in-person for the first time since the pandemic, at the CloudStack Collaboration Conference in Sofia last month.  The hybrid event hosted over 370 participants and 48 speakers from 32 countries!

Just like CCC, it was great to see new CloudStack committers and users, showing the growth of the global community.  </span></span></p><p><u><span><strong><span><span>Looking to the Future - Apache CloudStack 4.18 Release</span></span></strong></span></u></p><p><span>The community is looking forward to the upcoming 4.18 release, expected in late January 2023. Some exciting features you will be able to find in the new release are: </span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong>Edge computing (4.18) </strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the data source and end consumer. The presence of computing capabilities at the edge of the network reduces response times for applications while reducing connectivity costs. </span></span></p><p><span><span>This new feature will enable</span><span> operators to leverage CloudStack in deploying light-weight Zones in edge locations. Compared to the traditional CloudStack zones, a dehydrated zone results in resource savings on the boards - solving problems related to latency at low cost in regions poorly served by the internet network.</span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong>Tungsten SDN Fabric (4.18)</strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>Tungsten Fabric is an open-source SDN project that solves tooling complexity with the simplicity of only one networking and security tool. It is maintained by The Linux Foundation and is designed to support any cloud anywhere.  </span></span></p><p><span><span>From 4.18, Apache CloudStack users can leverage Tungsten Fabric as a Network Provider in Isolated and VPC Networks, adding this widely adopted SDN fabric to fill feature gaps in CloudStack, enhancing security and capabilities.</span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong>Autoscaling (4.18)</strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>This feature is an Apache CloudStack native solution, different from other approaches that created vendor lock-in of closed source products. From Apache CloudStack 4.18, cloud users can configure Autoscale VM Groups to dynamically scale up and down the number of Instances when the defined trigger conditions are met. </span></span></p><p><span><span>… and a lot more new capabilities, which will enable cloud operators to achieve more and manage easier their virtualisation. </span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><strong><u><span><span>At the end of the year…</span></span></u></strong></span></p><p><span>It was great to see another year of expansion of the Apache CloudStack community. We are happy to see new companies around the world adopting the technology and becoming involved in the community, whether it is through collaborations, development or keeping active on the mailing lists. In order for an open-source project to develop and be successful, people need to give back to the project - something that the Apache CloudStack community does extremely well. We are very grateful to the community’s efforts and progression in the technology, so kudos to all involved!  </span></p><p><span>New use cases are being shared, such as <a href="https://www.arsat.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARSAT</a> covering their use cases regarding cloud services in Argentinian government entities and also sharing their mid-term roadmap strategy to include the private sector in Arsat´s client portfolio. Another thing worth reflecting on is how companies who have been adopting Apache CloudStack long-term have managed to build reliable solutions and are using the technology continuously without looking for alternatives. The reason being because CloudStack is constantly expanding its supported integrations and technologies landscape, plus the amazing pace of development and new features released. Last but not least, we also see more vendors interested in both adopting CloudStack or building new solutions on top of it like <a href="https://www.apiculus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apiculus</a> and <a href="https://www.stackbill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackBill</a> for example. </span></p><p><span>We would like to say a big thank you to everyone involved in the project and look forward to collaborating at the CloudStack European User Group in May!</span></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/news">news</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2022-roundup">CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2022 Roundup</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-11-30T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 30, 2022</time></div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/IvetPM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/IvetPM.png" alt="Ivet Petrova"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/IvetPM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ivet Petrova</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">PMC Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/f434e02a-eb78-481e-bc5c-070ceeb6acba"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/f434e02a-eb78-481e-bc5c-070ceeb6acba" alt="banner.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><br>CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2022 took place on 14th-16th November.

It consists of two well-concerted components. LINSTOR and DRBD. Each of them also has its independent use cases, where it is deployed alone. In this presentation, the combination of these two is examined. They form the control plane and the data plane of the SDS. We will touch on: Performance, scalability, hyper-convergence (data-locality for high IO performance), resiliency through data replication (synchronous within a site, 2-way, 3-way, or more), snapshots, backup (to S3), encryption at rest, deduplication, compression, placement policies (regarding failure domains), management CLI and webGUI, monitoring interface, self-healing (restoring redundancy after device/node failure), the federation of multiple sites (async mirroring and repeatedly snapshot difference shipping), QoS control (noisy neighbors limitation) and of course: complete integration with CloudStack for KVM guests. It is Open Source software following the Unix philosophy. Each component solves one task, made for maximal re-usability. The solution leverages the Linux kernel, LVM and/or ZFS, and many Open Source software libraries. Building on these giant Open Source foundations, not only saves LINBIT from re-inventing the wheels, it also empowers your day 2 operation teams since they are already familiar with these technologies.</div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEWjocVhzno&amp;list=PLnIKk7GjgFlYcKNbhYSgWGbJ8nJ0g496V&amp;index=22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/3a720046-c093-4636-83bb-e48f4f64da92" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 11.41.03.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/a81uXODtt3KItT" width="854" height="712" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> </iframe><div><strong>About Phillip Reisner:</strong></div><div>Philipp Reisner is one of the founders and CEO of LINBIT in Vienna/Austria.

With the help of Stack Console’s reseller management module and CloudStack, a data center or cloud service provider can build resellers/partners and provide them with an automated white-label cloud management platform so they can sell cloud services under their own brand, such as compute, Kubernetes, load balancer, block storage, and so on. Many of resellers are likely to be small and medium-sized businesses that want to get into the cloud market, so this is great news for them.

Most companies are evaluating how to migrate to newer, flexible, and automated platforms. Cloud-Native provides the answer, as well as the complications. Cloud-Native solutions are building themselves alone across the business, but who&#x27;s securing them? Jesus will discuss the evolution of infrastructure solutions to Cloud Native, how can they be secured on CloudStack, what opensource security options are available today for CloudStack and where the future is leading towards Cloud Native security for CloudStack.</p><p><strong>15:00 - 15:30 - Boosting I/O Performance with KVM io_uring, </strong>Wido den Hollander, CLDIN B.V.<u></u></p><p>Storage performance is becoming much more important. KVM io_uring attempts to bring the I/O performance of a virtual machine to almost the same level as bare metal. Apache CloudStack has support for io_uring since version 4.16. Wido will show the difference in performance io_uring brings to the table.</p><p><strong>15:40 - 16:10 - Backup and Restore VMs based on KVM, </strong>Quentin Roccia &amp; Joffrey Luangsaysana, Dimsi</p><p>Dimsi has developed a backup solution for Virtual Machines based on KVM hypervisors. Every layer of the product uses Open Source libraries or components (Python, VueJS, Celery, Borg Backup, Redis, Socketio, Flask). There is no agent needed on the VMs. Dimsi has implemented a feature to group the hosts based on their use (CloudStack Hosts or Management Hosts) and apply specific policies to the groups. In the CloudStack context, this product can help you backup and restore all your VMs easily if the hypervisors are KVM-based. Moreover, restoring the VMs is effortless because KVM and CloudStack use the same id for the VM disks, so no need to hack the database to match them.</p><p><strong>16:20 - 17:05 - A Kubernetes CAPI Provider for Apache CloudStack, </strong>Peter (Motyka) Motykowski, Sr. Software Development Manager - Customer Engineering at Amazon Web Services (AWS)</p><p>Discover the new Kubernetes CAPI (Cluster-API) provider for Apache CloudStack &quot;CAPC&quot;, enabling you to manage a range of Kubernetes clusters across Apache CloudStack and other supported infrastructure providers!CAPI is a Kubernetes sub-project focused on providing declarative APIs and tooling to simplify provisioning, upgrading, and operating multiple Kubernetes clusters. Started by the Kubernetes SIG (Special Interest Group) Cluster Lifecycle, the CAPI project uses Kubernetes-style APIs and patterns to automate cluster lifecycle management for platform operators. CAPI relies on infrastructure providers to provision the underlying infrastructure components.<br>In this talk, you will find out more about the newly developed provider, its capabilities, and how you can benefit from it!</p><p><strong>17:15 - 17:45 - Expose Router VM Statistics to Customers, </strong>Sina Kashipazha, Leaseweb</p><p>In recent years, some of Leaseweb’s customers complained about the router VM resource usage and its availability. This made the company think that it would be nice to expose router VM statistics to the customers using the Prometheus format. In that way, they can set up their monitoring system and have more visibility over their network. Although it is still under development, Leaseweb thought it would be nice to discuss the project with the community members and gather feedback.</p><p><strong>17:45 - 19:00 - Networking and Beers</strong></p><hr><p><a href="https://events.hubilo.com/cloudstack-european-user-group/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>REGISTER NOW</strong></a></p><hr><p><strong>LEARN MORE ABOUT THE SPEAKERS:</strong></p><p><strong>Giles Sirett</strong></p><p>Giles is a committer, PMC member of the Apache CloudStack project and Chairman of the European CloudStack User Group.
