The fact that the solution is hypervisor-agnostic allows different types of enterprises to use CloudStack as a cloud orchestration no matter the rest of their tech stack.</p><p>We decided to get in touch with a few community members and ask for their perspectives on the project. In this article, CloudStack users from organisations that adopted the open-source software give their answers to the following questions: </p><p><strong>1)   Describe what your use case is with CloudStack?</strong></p><p><strong>2)   What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></p><p><strong>3)   What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you?</strong></p><p>We interviewed different members of the community to demonstrate and share the array of capabilities Apache CloudStack has to offer. Reading through the blog will introduce you to some of the known companies in the community, and what exactly their service offerings are. In this article you will also find out how Apache CloudStack stands out amongst other cloud orchestration platforms, for reasons such as: its ease of implementation, reliability, cost-effectiveness, it’s open-source approach and more!</p><p> </p><p><span><strong>Sven Vogel, Senior Manager R&amp;D - Cloud and Infrastructure, </strong><a href="https://www.ewerk.com/startseite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>EWERK</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Sven is the senior R&amp;D manager for Cloud &amp; Infrastructure at EWERK Group. Sven is a German IT-Specialist with 15+ year’s experience in IT and a member of the Apache Software Foundation.</strong></p><p><strong>EWERK supports European companies in the field of system-relevant infrastructures. So far, they have supported over 500 companies who have put their trust into IT projects and consulting expertise.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Describe what your use case is with CloudStack?</strong></li></ul><p>“In general, at EWERK we use Apache CloudStack as an IaaS platform for critical infrastructures in the areas of finance, health and public infrastructure. Due to the changes and new requirements in the market, especially for micro services, the use of PaaS and the Apache CloudStack Kubernetes service is becoming increasingly important. Crucial to the success is the ability to deploy all components via API or configuration management and deployment tools, such as Ansible or Terraform.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“The main advantage of Apache CloudStack is its open-source approach and the involvement of a diverse community from different countries. Everyone brings their best to the project, according to their abilities.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you?</strong> </li></ul><p>“I think it&#x27;s important to continue to form a good community and thus prepare the development of the project for the future. Furthermore, I see various topics such as network, Kubernetes and their automation as a challenge. Good integration of the many components in all areas from hypervisor to storage must be ensured.”</p><p> </p><p><span><strong>Wido den Hollander, CTO, </strong><a href="https://www.cldin.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ClouDINfra</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Wido den Hollander Is the Chief Technology Officer at ClouDINfra. He has been a part of the CloudStack community since 2012. Ever since he has contributed various parts of code like Ceph/RBD, IPv6, KVM and many other parts.</strong></p><p><strong>ClouDINfra’s mission is to build best-in-class digital infrastructures which scale. </strong><strong>The company works exclusively for a select number of large web services providers and supports a significant part of the Dutch IT infrastructure and public internet. Its end-users represent anything from small (or very big) webshops to critical infrastructure.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Describe what your use case is with CloudStack?</strong></li></ul><p>“At cloudinfra we use CloudStack for our internal private cloud where we <br>host the (web)services for our hundreds of thousands of customers. Using the KVM hypervisor with Ceph storage we are able to run a cost-effective yet reliable and scalable cloud platform.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“Being open source and governed by the ASF protects CloudStack from being influenced too much by commercial drivers and allows us to easily participate in the project.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you?</strong> </li></ul><p>“Private cloud deployments which are properly connected to deployment and orchestration tooling allow for easy use and adoption of CloudStack within a company.”</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span><strong>Kshitish Purohit, Co-Founder, </strong><a href="https://www.indiqus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>IndiQus Technologies</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Kshitish is the Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer at IndiQus. Kshitish has over 15 years of experience in the user experience, product management and startup domains, and has been an entrepreneur for all his career.</strong></p><p><strong>IndiQus is a fast-growing Cloud solutions company that works with Telecom Service Providers (Telcos, ISPs and Datacenter providers) globally and enables them to build a profitable in-country cloud business.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Describe what your use case is with CloudStack?</strong></li></ul><p>“Our Product - Apiculus - works deeply with CloudStack and offers a complete cloud customer life cycle management suite for independent cloud service providers. While CloudStack handles the technical orchestration (of Compute, Storage and Networking resources), Apiculus complements that by adding layers of billing, marketing, monitoring, support and unified marketplace capabilities.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“The simplicity of setting up and managing complex network architectures, along with a community that’s deeply invested in solving real-world use cases, are what, I believe, set CloudStack apart from other orchestration platforms.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you? </strong></li></ul><p>“I see CloudStack as serving two different niches in the near future. One, as enterprises are bringing their workloads ‘back’ to their premises, CloudStack is going to play a key role, as owning and managing a CloudStack setup is much more efficient (w.r.t. manpower, costs, complexity) than other orchestrators. Two, as the future is going closer and closer to the end user (Edge, Web3 etc.), the portability of CloudStack makes it an ideal candidate to embrace cloud-native and Edge-native technologies to deliver powerful orchestration capabilities nearer to the end users.”</p><p> </p><p><span><strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, </strong><a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ShapeBlue</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Giles is the CEO and founder of ShapeBlue. He is responsible for overall company strategy, strategic relationships, finance and sales. He is also a committer and PMC member of the Apache CloudStack project and Chairman of the European CloudStack User Group, actively helping promote brand awareness of the technology.</strong></p><p><strong>ShapeBlue is the largest independent integrator of CloudStack technologies globally and are specialists in the design and implementation of IaaS cloud infrastructures for both private and public cloud implementations.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Describe what your use case is with CloudStack?</strong></li></ul><p>“ShapeBlue’s use case with CloudStack is different to most organisations who are using CloudStack. Most organisations are using CloudStack to drive either public cloud implementation or to orchestrate internally within an enterprise. As ShapeBlue is the company that provides services around CloudStack, we see our role as representing those customers in the open-source project. Secondary to that, we do use CloudStack in our own internal CI/CD environment, but that is a relatively small scale compared to most people using CloudStack.” </p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“Against other IaaS orchestration platforms, CloudStack has got two key advantages: A) Ease of deployment - whereas a lot of other platforms are incredibly complex to deploy. B) Reliability - CloudStack has been around for over a decade, it’s very stable, it’s very well-known, it’s in production use at many of the world’s largest organisations.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you? </strong></li></ul><p>“CloudStack’s scope will remain tightly defined. CloudStack does not have aspirations to become a new block storage platform or to become a container orchestrator, it’s highly defined at the level, which is the virtualised based orchestration layer. CloudStack will become increasingly reliable, increasingly easy to deploy, and effectively we hope will just become boring.”</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span><strong>Philipp Reisner, CEO, </strong><a href="https://linbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>LINBIT</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Philipp Reisner is one of the founders and CEO of LINBIT. His professional career has been dominated by developing DRBD, a storage replication software for Linux.</strong></p><p><strong>LINBIT is an Open Source company offering enterprise-level support subscriptions for its Open Source technologies.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Describe what your use case is with CloudStack?</strong></li></ul><p>“LINBIT develops a software-defined storage solution that is seamlessly integrated with CloudStack. As CloudStack, it is OpenSource software composed out of DRBD, LINSTOR, and LVM/ZFS.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“As LINBIT&#x27;s SDS is available for multiple cloud software stacks and enterprise virtualization stacks, we have a bit of insight into multiple communities. The CloudStack community is thriving, and we see that CloudStack is heavily adopted in mid-sized deployments.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you? </strong></li></ul><p>“I expect CloudStack will find more large-scale adopters as the hype around the big competing technology cools off.”</p><p> </p><p><span><strong>Grégoire Lamodière, Founder, </strong><a href="https://cloud.dimsi.io/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>DIMSI</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Grégoire Lamodière is the Co-founder of DIMSI. Grégoire is a software architect who spends most of his time designing infrastructure applications and CRM systems, on-premise or multi-cloud based.

I am based out of Delhi, India and am passionate about travelling and dig going on driving holidays with my friends and family. I love listening to music and ABBA has been my all-time favourite band since childhood.</p><p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet?</strong></p><p>As a commerce graduate, moving to an IT career accidentally was probably the best thing that happened to me. I subsequently completed my masters in software engineering and worked as a developer with different ISPs where my interest in infrastructure programming was kindled.</p><p><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>My first exposure to CloudStack was in 2013 and since then I have embarked on a very exciting journey where I have evolved from a CloudStack user to an evangelist. I love tinkering on CloudStack and the techno-commercial possibilities it offers to the regional Internet, Cloud and Data Center providers.</p><p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>I have received a lot of help from the community. If I must take a single name, it would be Rohit Yadav. He has been my mentor and will probably remain so for a while as far as CloudStack is concerned. During my initial days, folks from Citrix helped me a lot too, Vimmy Hong for one.</p><p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong></p><p>My commitment to CloudStack has been indirect but impacting. It has been taking it to the industry - the enterprises, telecoms, ISPs and data centre providers and showcasing how CloudStack can be leveraged as a viable cloud business model and implementing the same across various geographies. My organisation’s product offering is completely architected by leveraging CloudStack and transforming it into a techno-commercial solution.</p><p>On the technical side, I have worked extensively on various aspects of monitoring CloudStack and shared the same amongst the community. I am currently looking to implement an outside-in way of monitoring VRs and providing auto-scale facilities without modifying the CloudStack code.</p><p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong></p><p>It’s cost-effective, allows unmatched customising flexibility and it works! It’s that simple. Since it’s community-driven, it is always balanced. The collective intelligence of the community is always greater than the sum of each individual’s intelligence.</p><p>Many pairs of eyes mean tighter, more secure, more relevant and more efficient code. Your choice to pay for support is completely de-linked from the licence to use the product. What’s more, there are a plethora of licences to choose from to leverage the same in your own product/service offering.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Follow him on Twitter: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/kbshivkumar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="https://twitter.com/kbshivkumar">https://twitter.com/kbshivkumar</a></p><p><strong>Connect with him on LinkedIn: </strong><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/kbshiv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="https://in.linkedin.com/in/kbshiv">https://in.linkedin.com/in/kbshiv</a></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/community">community</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/meet-the-community-simon-weller">Meet the Community - Simon Weller - VP of Apache CloudStack</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 9, 2022</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/3cc5849c-9512-4afd-a4f6-d22038d97990"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/3cc5849c-9512-4afd-a4f6-d22038d97990" alt="Screenshot 2022-05-09 at 11.26.23.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Simon Weller is the new VP of Apache CloudStack announced in late March 2022. Simon has been an Apache CloudStack PMC member for the last few years. He has a strong technology background in multiple competencies, including networking and systems. In addition to it, he has a significant business development background with both start-ups and established organizations and is a highly experienced strategic thinker and relationship builder.</p><p>Currently, Simon Weller is the Vice President Of Technology of Education Networks of America. He is responsible for the technology initiatives at ENA across the Systems, R&amp;D, Internal Systems and Data Architecture and Business Intelligence teams. Simon is also heavily involved in product development and business development.</p><p>Ivet Petrova, Marketing Director at ShapeBlue interviewed Simon as part of the Meet the Community Series. You can watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sVYGehxsn0&amp;t=332s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Below, you can find some of the key point’s Simon laid out in the video.</p><p><strong>Тhe </strong><strong>Evolution of Apache CloudStack: </strong><strong>Continue the community vision and drive forward</strong></p><p>‘I think that every project that gets accepted under the Apache umbrella always has to try and build that really important base of community, because without that community, you can&#x27;t survive. We see a lot of projects that have got a lot of excitement and they just fade away. I think what&#x27;s been really great about CloudStack over the years is that we&#x27;ve managed to really continue that community vision and we&#x27;ve got a really great core group of people that have been around a long time that still have that passion and want to encourage others to participate as well. But the most important thing of open source is, you have to get others to want to contribute and you have to get others to want to give up some of their time and effort in order to make sure that you don&#x27;t just survive, but that you can actually drive forward a project into the future and make it sustainable.’</p><p><strong>The Everyday Problems Open-source Solutions Solve: Building a Long-term sustainability</strong></p><p>‘Part of what I&#x27;ve done since I started in technology has always been trying to leverage the best technology and the best open-source solutions that we can. But I think one thing that is often missed by a lot of enterprise environments and organisations is that they think that they can just take and just walk away. But the most important thing to sustainability long term is you have to be able to give back as well. So, part of what my mission has always been working at open source for a long time, is making sure that when we do talk to others and we encourage them to try the technology out and hopefully implement it into production, but also think about how are they going to give back long term so that the product and the project is sustainable.’</p><p><strong>The Secret of a Successful Open-source Community: Engagement in all areas</strong></p><p>‘I think it&#x27;s a bit of a misnomer that a lot of people have that you have to be a developer in order to be able to give back to open-source. So, I&#x27;m not a great developer, I dabble a little bit, but I&#x27;m not going to claim that I&#x27;m the best developer suited for any particular environmental project. Where I come in personally is I really try and give back to the user base from an engineering perspective. You&#x27;ve got a problem -how do we help you fix it? You want to implement a potential way of doing things - how can we encourage others to collaborate on it together? So, I think that a lot of people need to get out of that mindset, that you&#x27;ve got to be a coder in order to be able to give back to open source. There are so many other areas that you can contribute. I mean, case in point Ivet, you&#x27;re fantastic at what you do, but you&#x27;re not a developer, right? But you are encouraging others through your engagement practises, through organising events, through promoting the project overall to the community. And that is just as important, if not more so than ever writing a line of code. So I think that a lot of people need to start to maybe think about other areas that they can contribute outside of just writing a line of code, because a project doesn&#x27;t survive long term unless you have that marketing capability, unless you have the outreach and you&#x27;re able to encourage new participants because ultimately you&#x27;re always going to have some people leaving the community and you need a long, robust pipeline of new members coming in to help out as well.’</p><p><strong>Implementing CloudStack: Scalability, simplicity and reliability</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>‘I think that what draws a lot of people to CloudStack is the fact that it supports a lot of different technologies. And a lot of companies at some point get to a realisation that they have to scale their environment. And doing that with a lot of the other products on the market with a commercial open source can be quite challenging. And case in point, we&#x27;ve seen a lot of folks over the years that have started off with VMware or they might have started off with a public cloud solution like AWS or Azure or Google Cloud. They get to a point and then they figure out, well, how are we going to scale this? And let me explain what I mean by that, because a lot of people right now are saying, well, of course, you can scale AWS or Azure or Google Cloud, you can, but at a massive cost. So, scaling comes in to both how to make money long term if you&#x27;re a commercial entity. And how to minimise those costs, how do you make it more manageable and how do you get to that next level? So, I think a lot of entities that start looking at that solution, such as Apache CloudStack, I think in not just about the pure technology play, but their thinking about the viability of the product long-term. Typically, what we see is that as new companies get started, or even established companies get started, they see a higher margin opportunity on the front end, and over time that starts to get a bit more commoditized. They&#x27;re looking for areas of savings in the underlying technology, and I think that&#x27;s where a lot of people start to look at CloudStack. I think also you see other people and other companies that have been at open-source for a long time. And they might have deployed KVM or some other hypervisor technology. And they just get to that technological point where they can no longer scale managing manually 100 hosts or something like that. And so, they start to look for orchestration methods to make their life easier. And that&#x27;s really where CloudStack shines.’</p><p><strong>The Benefits of Open-source Technology: Much more than cost-savings</strong></p><p>‘The number one thing that I always think about is flexibility. And the ability for you to take something that has already been built out and then add new capabilities to it, to meet the mission of your organisation&#x27;s goals. For example, we&#x27;ve contributed a lot of new features to CloudStack over the years that have been driven by customer demands. And that&#x27;s the best way to build a business, as you build stuff that customers want to buy. So, I think by utilising open source in general or CloudStack or any open-source tooling, it allows you to take a great set of features and functionality that will scale and then add your own secret sauce to it. Or as we often do, give back that secret sauce to the community so they can get a benefit from it as well.’</p><p><strong>Apache CloudStack: When and how it fits? </strong></p><p><strong> </strong>‘I&#x27;d like to say that it can suit everyone, but I think that&#x27;s probably not entirely true. I think that you have to have some level of expertise on your team in order to be able to support it long term. And that doesn&#x27;t mean that you need to have a massive team. The fact that could be a team one, but it does take, as with any software platform in any project, it does take expertise in order to operate at long term. So, what I would say is, is that if you were thinking about deploying Apache CloudStack and you already have a few Linux chops under your belt, then that&#x27;s probably more than enough for you to be able to explore and deploy. CloudStack is extraordinarily easy to deploy. We love to say that it just works. And that&#x27;s a true statement. But if something starts to go south, if something starts to go wrong, you&#x27;re going to have to start digging in a little better to the underpinnings of how the infrastructure works. Because you have to remember that CloudStack is effectively an orchestrator. It&#x27;s managing other components. So those other components can go south, but CloudStack could be fine, right? So, it&#x27;s important that you have a good understanding of how the ecosystem of various underpinnings of CloudStack functions so that you are more empowered to address problems if they do arise.’</p><p><strong>The Path of Constant Improvement</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>From IaaS to building PaaS products on top of Apache CloudStack</strong></p><p>‘I think the community is always looking for new ways to improve. No software platform is perfect, right? If it is, then we could just go home, open a bottle of wine, and everything would be great. To be realistic about it, there’s always new features. And the market is evolving at such a rapid pace these days that a lot of organisations are looking for new ways to be able to consume a service or consume a product. And I think that from CloudStack’s perspective, we&#x27;ve been very deliberate about where we plan, where we don&#x27;t play. So, CloudStack has typically always been an infrastructure as a service orchestrator play. And there are other folks out there that are taking that as the underpinnings and building various platform as a service on top. So, I think there&#x27;s always areas that we can improve and new features that we could add that are more underpinnings. But I think that one thing that we&#x27;ve always done really good at as a community is knowing where we play and where we don&#x27;t play, because in the end it&#x27;s fine to contribute a massive new feature, but if no one&#x27;s going to support it long term, then it&#x27;s very difficult to get others to come in and number one, help out with that and to be able to promote it.’</p><p><strong>Building a Stable Roadmap Inside an Open-source Community</strong></p><p>‘It often depends on open source of how the oversight is run. So, in some open-source projects, someone has decided that they want to open source and software and they put it up on GitHub and they are effectively God. They can do whatever they want. Whether other people support them or not is effectively irrelevant in that picture. But when you&#x27;ve got a large product or service that is inside a more structured entity such as Apache, we have a lot of guidance on how a community should interact. And I think honestly, that is very healthy because we really want others to contribute ideas. We need to have a robust discussion around things. And sometimes that robust discussion can be a bit difficult for certain people. But it is it is crucial that we get by from the community in order to chart the right path. So, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a typical product management style roadmap that we see in open source, but it is very important that as ideas are brought to the table, they are discussed and that others are willing to support the overall vision so that we do go in the right direction. I think the other component too and we see this quite a lot in CloudStack is, we have commercial entities out there that are providing support and development services. Good examples of that is ShapeBlue and CloudOps and others. And they have customers that might say, you know what? We want you to develop this new feature for CloudStack, and then they agree to open source it and give it back to the community. So that&#x27;s also a great way to continue to feature development because those features are often very commercially driven. And considering we are obviously predominantly used by those that commercially driven, those features can be easy to adopt by others as well.’</p><p><strong>Release Management: Rapid Development of New Features and Capabilities</strong></p><p>‘We try and keep the release cadence pretty consistent overall. We have major releases and we have minor dot releases that are really focussed very much on critical bug fixes because in the end, the operator&#x27;s utilising CloudStack expect stability. And so, we have to be quite deliberate about what we will allow and what we won&#x27;t allow. So typically, when we&#x27;re talking about a major release such as 4.16 or the future for 4.17, we are talking about new features that could be breaking changes. Potentially, we&#x27;ll have high risk associated with them. If we&#x27;re talking about 4.16.1, then we&#x27;re talking about very, very minor changes that are totally focussed on stability and bug fixes. In terms of how we decide what features are going to new major release milestones, that&#x27;s really got a lot to do with what has been reviewed and what the overall community is comfortable with. So, if an organisation or a developer brings in a new feature, they will open a pull request and they will request that to be merged and they will request review of that pull request via members of the community. And the members of the community will then make suggestions, or they might say, you know what, this is a cool feature, but we think it might break something else. And so, we would work with that contributor to figure out maybe how to re-implement that. But a very important part of CloudStack is stability. So, we always smoke test all of the new features that come in because we want to make sure that we are providing that long term stability that our users expect.’</p><p><strong>Becoming Part of Apache CloudStack: An advice for developers</strong></p><p>‘CloudStack is a huge project. I mean, the amount of code at times is a bit mind boggling. And I think the number one thing that I would recommend to someone who wants to get into development is become part of the mailing lists. You know, we have great development mailing lists, we have great user mailing lists and get a test environment set up, start to play with it, start to understand the features, how the features work in your environment, and then start to explore the code. And don&#x27;t be scared of asking questions. You know, we have a great group of people who are really, really willing to help. And I, for one, want to make sure that anyone who comes to the community is going to get a benefit of being able to hopefully avoid the pain and suffering that some of us have gone through trying to figure out how certain things work. If you’re trying to implement something in a particular driver, I guarantee there’s someone that has already suffered that pain before. So just asking on the mailing list, we can find that right person for you and they can hopefully help shortcut that learning curve. And the events are fantastic. During the COVID era which has obviously been challenging for all of us, we have had some of our biggest online events. Ivet you have produced and made them super successful which is fantastic. And so, it’s just great seeing all these new people come out of the woodwork who are willing to learn and willing to become part of the community.’</p><p><strong>The Targets of the VP: Simon’s vision for the CloudStack development</strong></p><p>‘I’m very lucky that the PMC’s voted for me to be in this role and I just want to thank them for the support. Really, I just am going to be continuing on from the trailblazing people before me. We’ve had a great group of others that have been in the VP position over the last decade. And I think the number one thing that every single person in this role wants, is to help drive forward the vision in the community around Apache CloudStack. So, that’s really what I want to help do, I want to continue to talk to as many people as possible and hopefully encourage them to be part of the community so that we can continue to see the widescale success that we’re known for. And I think part of getting out there and promoting the overall project is the desire to have more users. Because in the end we need that strong user base to not just survive, but to thrive. And there’s always going to be a new use case that someone figures out. I think what we are starting to see more and more in the enterprise community right now is that public cloud is always going to be there. And I think that as some larger enterprises start to look at their costs associated with that, their starting to look a little bit more wider field of what the other options might be. So, we’re seeing more and more companies saying, well look I know we said we weren’t going to go and rent co-locations space again and put in servers and run our own cloud. But we should really run the numbers and figure out what they would look like’</p><p><strong>CloudStack in 3 words</strong></p><p>‘It just works’</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/community">community</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/meet-the-community-nicolas-vazquez">Meet the Community - Nicolas Vazquez</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-03-21T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 21, 2022</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/dfd89976-747e-4737-b71b-198c8f53e31a"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/dfd89976-747e-4737-b71b-198c8f53e31a" alt="Meet-CS-Community-Nicolas.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>The Apache CloudStack Community is an ever-growing and rapidly-developed community of people all around the globe committed to open-source technology.

He spends his time designing and implementing features in  CloudStack and can be seen acting as a release manager also.</p><p><strong>Introduce yourself with a few words?</strong></p><p>My name is Nicolas Vazquez, and I am a software engineer. I am 31 years old, based in Uruguay and work as a Senior Software Engineer at Shapeblue. I&#x27;m happily married and also a father of a young girl. I am a fan of sports, enjoy playing tennis and football. I also enjoy reading and listening to economic and political materials.</p><p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet?</strong></p><p>I have a degree in Computer Science and have worked on software development for the last 9 years. For the first years, I have worked mostly as a Java developer and since I met CloudStack I have been learning more about networking, storage, virtualisation. I became a CloudStack Committer in 2016 and a PMC member last year.</p><p><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>I have met CloudStack in 2015 while I was working for my previous job. I personally didn&#x27;t know about CloudStack but got assigned to a development project for it and that is where I started investigating and learning about it. I have been actively contributing and learning a lot since then.</p><p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>My first mentor was Sergey Levitskiy. After I have joined Shapeblue, my mentor has been Rohit Yadav. I admire and appreciate both of them. I also enjoy acting as a mentor, recently have been assisting other community members - Suresh on the Release Management of the 4.16.1.0 release - which was released earlier this month.</p><p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong></p><p>My last commitment to CloudStack was acting as the Release Manager for the version 4.16.0 and also for the upcoming 4.17.0 version. Version 4.16.0 was released in November 2021 and introduces many interesting new features and improvements.</p><p>I am currently contributing by being the Release Manager for the upcoming 4.17 release of CloudStack. It is expected to bring a bunch of enhancements and new capabilities, such as improvements in the IPv6 support, shared networks, UX improvements for VM and volume migration and a lot more.</p><p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong></p><p>I think the power of open-source technologies is that these solutions are not bound to any company and are the result of many individuals from different companies interacting and cooperating to build the best possible product. This is beneficial for the users as the product can be extended by anyone and contributed back to the whole community. Last but not least, the support of the community is also very important, and in my opinion, CloudStack is an excellent example of a successful open-source project.</p><p><strong>Learn more about Nicolas:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nvazquez" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/nvazquez</a></p><p><strong>Follow him on Twitter: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/nvazquezuy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/nvazquezuy</a></p><p> </p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/community">community</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/meet-the-community-slavka-peleva">Meet the Community - Slavka Peleva</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-03-08T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 8, 2022</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/3c28586e-9ec1-4584-869b-2f8e7f3a2aa7"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/3c28586e-9ec1-4584-869b-2f8e7f3a2aa7" alt="Meet-CS-Community-SLAVKA.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>The Apache CloudStack Community is an ever-growing and rapidly-developed community of people all around the globe committed to open-source technology.

She is part of the CloudStack community for the last 3 years and is excited to work on new features and capabilities to improve the open-source cloud management solution.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Introduce yourself with a few words?</strong><br>Hi, I am Slavka Peleva and I work at StorPool Storage as a software developer. I have a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Automation, information and control systems. I am a mother of a teenage boy. I love to read fantasy books, snowboarding in winters and rollerblading in summers.</p><p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet.</strong><br>I have always loved puzzles and brain teasers. For me, programming is an art. I have a passion for debugging and digging into the code.</p><p><br><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong><br>In the middle of 2019 I have started to work at StorPool Storage. Then I did my first steps into CloudStack and it was my first open-source project. Since then I learned a lot and I met interesting people.</p><p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong><br>My colleagues at StorPool. I аm very happy that I have the chance to work with such exceptional professionals. Thanks to them the beginning was not so hard. I should also thank Rohit Yadav and ShapeBlue who shared with me the hackerbook. When I felt a bit comfortable in the community I have started to bother most of the guys :) I am glad that the people in CloudStack&#x27;s community are really supportive and nice and they have helped me in my journey.</p><p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong><br>Most of my contributing PRs are related to fixes with storage issues. One of the features that I have developed in CloudStack still did not get in but I hope that happens in the next release. It is for storage-based VM snapshots on KVM. Libvirt does not give the option to take virtual machine snapshots on images with RAW format. With this feature, the storage will have the functionality to take group consistent snapshots on all volumes of a virtual machine.</p><p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong><br>The biggest advantage is the quality. A lot of developers are actively going through the code and making changes and only the best changes get into the final version. The contributions that every one of us does is what makes CloudStack such a powerful technology that so many system administrators and solutions architects use to build up their clouds.</p><p><strong>Learn more about Slavka:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/slavkap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/slavkap</a></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/community">community</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/meet-the-community-david-jumani">Meet the Community - David Jumani</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-01-13T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">January 13, 2022</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><a href="/img/imported/1033b38c-1717-4707-9098-fdc208260857"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/1033b38c-1717-4707-9098-fdc208260857" alt="Meet-CS-Community-David-Jumani.png" width="750" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>The Apache CloudStack Community is an ever-growing and rapidly-developed community of people all around the globe committed to open-source technology.

Learn more about her!</p><b>Introduce yourself with a few words?</b><p>Hi, I&#x27;m Pearl Dsilva, with about 5 years of experience in Telecommunications and Cloud Computing. I&#x27;m based in Bangalore, India, and currently work at ShapeBlue. I have done my Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Engineering in E&amp;C. Since then, my career has been mainly in Telecommunications and Cloud management.
I am an avid reader who likes to devour fiction books and binge-watch series over weekends. Self-learning and self-motivation are the mantras that I follow to keep myself abreast with new things in our field of work. Never averse to taking a new role, responsibilities, and tasks that require reinventing myself.</p><b>Tell us your story in one Tweet.</b><p>An Electronics &amp; Communications Engineer who developed an interest in networking and communications in distributed systems. Over the years, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to work in cloud computing, network management, cloud automation, and orchestration. I would like to give credit to my first company, where I joined as a campus recruit for providing me guidance, training, and exposure in the related field. The mentors that I had played a massive role in skill development which has played a significant role in what I am today. All this led me to an opportunity to work on CloudStack and be a part of the community.</p><b>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</b><p>In November 2019, I started dabbling with CloudStack. It began as something that I did as part of my job. But as time passed by, I realised it was fun working on an open-source project. There are many ways to contribute and be involved, and the community members are helpful. And this journey goes on …</p><b>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</b><p>Rohit Yadav has been an absolute mentor right from day one. From helping me understand CloudStack to getting me around with how the community works, Rohit&#x27;s always been there to help and support. He has been a great motivator, especially the role he played during the onboarding process. The learning by interacting with him and the other community members has been immense.</p><b>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed, or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</b><p>Among the features I&#x27;ve worked on, the most recent ones include enabling automatic upgrades in CloudStack - without needing to register the SystemVM template prior to the upgrade, support for bulk actions in the UI, and custom Resource Icons support.</p><b>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</b><p>Opensource software is agile and flexible, and the users can easily contribute or propose ideas that they intend to see in the project. Furthermore, it is backed by an involved community, which makes it a better option compared to proprietary software in many ways.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/community">community</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/meet-the-community-gabriel-brascher">Meet the Community - Gabriel Brascher - VP of Apache CloudStack</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-04-21T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">April 21, 2021</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Gabriel Beims Bräscher is the new VP of Apache CloudStack since March 2021.

A person, who is friendly, open-minded and ready to help everyone in the community!</p><a href="/img/imported/6d6dbf9f-d964-496f-82af-a4c764e5f865"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6d6dbf9f-d964-496f-82af-a4c764e5f865?t=true" alt="Gabriel-VPACS.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></a><b>1. What exactly is the role of VP of Apache CloudStack?</b><p>To give some context let’s start with a bit of Apache.</p><p>The Apache Software Foundation controls over 300+ Projects. Therefore, it is quite hard for a single Apache Board to stay close and manage all the projects.</p><p>With that in mind, each project holds a group of contributors capable of managing supervising the project following the Apache guidelines; this group is called Project Management Committee (PMC). A project VP is a PMC Chair appointed by the Apache Board.</p><p>The VP serves as a bridge between the ASF Board and the Project, providing reports to the Apache Board on a quarterly basis. VP also holds an important role in terms of marketing the project and orchestrating discussions.</p><br><b>2. If you look at CloudStack, it has played a critical role for many solutions providers and companies who search for ease of use and deployment. Which companies can benefit the most from CloudStack?</b><p>Any company that deploys and consumes large loads of computer resources can benefit from CloudStack. Some examples are:</p><p>· Cloud Providers: they are a perfect match as their core business is Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)</p><p>· Telecommunications Companies: are transiting to large cloud infrastructures; especially with the wide change on the communication industry (migrating from traditional Telephone &amp; TV to wireless mobile and Internet technologies)</p><p>· Universities and Research Rroups: need large scale systems for running experiments and also maintaining multiple services for students, professors, and researchers</p><p>· Enterprises / Governmental Organizations: they process and store loads of data, and need elastic computer resources to comply with their demands</p><p>In summary, these companies have something in common:</p><ol><li><p>The costs with public clouds are higher than deploying and managing their own Private Cloud.</p></li><li><p>Also, some companies must control their data and will not process them on third-parties.</p></li></ol><p>In all those cases CloudStack has proven to be a competitive option.</p><br><b>3. Choosing a cloud management system is a hard thing, especially if you have a long history with specific technologies. Why should companies migrate to CloudStack?</b><p>That is true. Choosing such a system is hard and it requires evaluating many aspects, such as the goals, expectations, and technical background that the company already has.</p><p>CloudStack can handle a wide set of hypervisors, and instead of creating new components and projects, it focuses on connecting and managing solid technologies such as iSCSI, NFS, and Ceph. Additionally, it allows configuring guest networks with IPv6 protocol for VMs, which is not commonly supported by other cloud orchestration systems.</p><p>In short: a good thing from CloudStack for companies planning to migrate to Private Cloud is that it adopted technologies that are out in the industry for decades and most of the Admins and Engineers are already used to them. This can cut deployment and operation costs.</p><br><b>4. On the development side, how easy it is to implement and manage CloudStack?</b><p>CloudStack, as any other cloud orchestration platform, is a complex solution; it requires IT professionals with multidisciplinary backgrounds, such as development skills (e.g. Java, Python, MySQL, Bash, Git, Node.js), as well as experience with virtualization, networking and storage systems. So it might take some time for a new developer to learn its way. However, Apache projects work hard to help newcomers; and CloudStack is no different. There are documentations that guide users, system admins, and developers. Deploying CloudStack can be easy when compared to other options and operating it can be simple to users that are well adapted with all the technologies in CloudStack.</p><br><b>5. What would you share about the community?</b><p>The fact that the project is managed by Apache Software Foundation provides all the Apache background on building an open-source community. It is one of our core goals to encourage experienced developers and users to help newcomers.</p><p>On top of that, assembling a community where everyone has a saying is one of the foundations of Apache projects. Therefore, we are always open to new ideas and feature requests.</p><br><b>6. How do you think we can all grow the CloudStack community?</b><p>It is very important to grow our community and I strongly believe that we should connect to students, researchers and professors in a way that we can bring young and passionate talents to develop our project.</p><p>Additionally, participating in conferences and writing for technical magazines can advertise Cloud computing Infrastructure-as-a-Service model as well as the CloudStack project.</p><br><b>7. What is the direction in which CloudStack is going as a technology?</b><p>We are working hard to keep it a reliable and stable solution; but it is also key to invest on user-friendly experience. A good project is one that can be easily deployed and used. We have been continuously enhancing the documentation; additionally, CloudStack has recently migrated to a new User Interface.</p><br><b>8. Many community members notice that CloudStack is becoming more and more appealing for enterprises. What would you advise this type of organisations?</b><p>Small-medium enterprises need to determine which deployment model best suits their Cloud strategy. There are pros and cons on any of the cloud options (private, public, or hybrid clouds).</p><p>Considering the complexity and challenges of deploying a cloud infrastructure, Cloudstack is reliable, easy to deploy, and can scale well. Additionally, CloudStack supports integration with public clouds; therefore it is a great option for hybrid clouds.</p><p>We have many known cases of companies that use it for a long time and have scaled their CloudStack Data Centers to huge amounts of Hosts and VMs. But there are also examples of small organizations that are benefiting from private clouds either as a key component of their core business or a tool for internal IT development and growth.</p><br><b>9. As a person, you are recognized for your contribution to CloudStack. How did you start with it?</b><p>It all started in 2013, when I was an undergrad student working at a research lab that wanted to deploy a Cloud orchestration platform. We chose CloudStack over all the options and I began my journey on the CloudStack world.</p><p>On the 1st November 2013 I sent my first mail to the CloudStack mailing list with some questions regarding the process of upgrading from CloudStack 4.1.1 to 4.2.0.</p><p>In December of 2015 I opened my first Pull Request, which led me to work closer to the community by interacting at the mailing lists, and proposing and reviewing implementations.</p><p>I became a committer in 2017 and worked as a Release Manager for CloudStack 4.12.0.0 in early 2018. By the end of 2018 I was invited to be part of the Apache CloudStack PMC.</p><br><b>10. Any advice to all developers, writing new features for CloudStack?</b><p>Open source is all about multiple developers creating and fixing code together; we must focus on maintainability, stability, and documentation.</p><p>When writing new features we should think about how other developers will debug and extend the code. In summary: write code as simple as possible.</p><p>I would recommend the following principles:</p><ol><li><p>Use clear and self-explaining variable names</p></li><li><p>Take advantage of coding libraries to use existing tools</p></li><li><p>Make it easy for other developers to work into the workflow</p></li><li><p>Keep it well documented</p></li><li><p>Make code reusable and avoid duplicated lines</p><br></li></ol><b>11. If you need to summarize CloudStack in 3 words, what would they be?</b><p>Open-source reliable clouds, or simply: it goes on!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/community">community</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://cloudstack.apache.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footerLogoLink_BH7S"><img src="/img/banner.svg" alt="Apache CloudStack logo" class="themedImage_ToTc themedImage--light_HNdA footer__logo"><img src="/img/banner.svg" alt="Apache CloudStack logo" class="themedImage_ToTc themedImage--dark_i4oU footer__logo"></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">
