thought. With the right technology stack, companies can quickly and easily
deploy a flexible and stable IaaS offering to support any business requirements,
as proIO discovered.</p><p><a href="https://www.proio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proIO</a> was founded in Frankfurt, Germany, nearly 20 years ago, as Swen Brüseke
explains. “We wanted to create a company based on holistic IT concepts,
providing support and advice from system design and creation through to smooth
day-to-day running of operations.”, said Swen Brüseke, CEO of proIO.</p><p>The company started by remotely looking after its customer’s physical servers
and data centres in both Frankfurt and Hamburg - 24/7. This has grown to the
extent that they now support thousands of physical servers.</p><p>During the last few years, customer demand has led proIO to extend its support
services with a fully managed cloud offering to become a Managed Service
Provider specialising in open-source Linux applications.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-proio2023.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><h2>А Move to CloudStack</h2><p>The company migrated its cloud to CloudStack in 2019 for a number of reasons, as
Swen explained. “We had used it for several years on various other projects, and
so we had acquired a great amount of working knowledge. This experience
demonstrated to us how easy it was to set up a proof of concept and deploy a
CloudStack-based solution. It was also much easier to keep up to date once
deployed compared to other solutions we had looked at.</p><h2>Fully Redundant Infrastructure Based on Open-Source Technologies</h2><p>Currently, more than 95% of proIO’s virtual machines are Linux based. “Our
customers are not bothered whether their operating system is open source or
not,” explained Swen. “They just want their apps to run to support their
business. We now look after all types of customers from healthcare, hotel
booking, through automotive and clothing to publishing.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-proio2023.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><br><br><p>“It’s great the way that everybody helps each other out in the community,
contributing what they can to ensure CloudStack continues to develop and refine
as a product. I would recommend CloudStack wholeheartedly to any organisation
that is looking at developing a cloud-based infrastructure.”, says Swen Brüseke,
CEO of proIO.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/case-studies">case-studies</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/future-proof-open-source-platform">Future-Proof Open-Source Platform Hosting Millions of Websites for Your.Online</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-03-08T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 8, 2023</time></div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/Ivet_H_Petrova" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1331984193392435200/djCqv-vM_400x400.jpg" alt="Ivet Petrova"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/Ivet_H_Petrova" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ivet Petrova</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">PMC Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/4d7d7c8f-3951-4d15-9340-b1360357d6f7"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/4d7d7c8f-3951-4d15-9340-b1360357d6f7" alt="banner.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p><a href="https://your.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your.Online</a> is a team of pioneers from all over the

brands - Versio, Yourhosting, Savvii and Axarnet. The four companies ran on
different infrastructure platforms using technologies like VMware, RHEV, Xen
server, Virtuozzo, Proxmox, custom-built solutions and many others. This made it
extremely hard and nearly impossible to manage their infrastructure centrally
and ensure reliability and operational effectiveness.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-your-online.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><h2>Building a Centralised Platform Based on CloudStack</h2><p>Your.Online has built a centralized platform powered by CloudStack, Ceph,
TrueNAS and KVM to be utilized by all their hosting brands. The new solution
allowed the company to simplify infrastructure management and have end-to-end
visibility of the processes inside from a single pane of glass.</p><p>Your.Online uses BGP, EVPN and VXLAN with CloudStack’s Advanced networking
model. This allows them to scale networks very easily in a redundant and
high-performant way over multiple data centers. This is a built-in functionality
of CloudStack, which when combined with IPv6 support and security groups makes
for a modern and future-proof solution, on which they can continue to invest and
grow.</p><h2>Ensuring Reliability in the Long Term</h2><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/85db8d29-cf32-409b-b3b2-1d23df9f598d" width="120px" class="img_ev3q">“One of the reasons to centralize on CloudStack is to have one single point of truth about the utilization of our assets. One overview of the VMs, assets and capacity utilization. Now we can automate against one platform, and for us, the main driver to choosing CloudStack was that it is an open-source project governed by the Apache Software Foundation. We know it is a stable platform both from a technical and legal perspective. The project will be live in the next ten years, allowing us to avoid the risk associated with commercial projects - usually licensing and governance problems.”<b>- Wido den Hollander, CTO, Your.Online</b><br><br><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-your-online.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><h2>About Your.Online</h2><p>Your.Online is a leading European online services platform supporting businesses

In this Solution Brief, TF integrates with CloudStack as an SDN plugin to enable rich networking capabilities and lifecycle management of VMs and containers where TF components or control functions are deployed.</p><p>The deployment and life-cycle management of Tungsten Fabric can be done with tools like Ansible. After Tungsten Fabric and CloudStack are installed, we need to create a zone with the TF isolation method, and then, when we create a network or a vm in CloudStack, TF plugin will call the TF Controller API to create the resources.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-tungsten-fabric-sdn.pdf"><b>DOWNLOAD THE SOLUTION BRIEF</b></a><br><br><strong>Key Outcomes for Users</strong><p>Apache Cloudstack has long provided flexibility regarding network configuration to serve the needed use case. Along with built-in functionality, ACS has supported a number of different Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers, including VMware NSX multi-hypervisor (formally Nicara), Nuage and others.</p><p>However, Apache CloudStack lacked a fully-featured open-source SDN controller to deliver advanced networking features.  </p><p>Apache Cloudstack&#x27;s integration with Tungsten Fabric will finally close this feature gap providing many long sought-after features, including BGP, MPLS, service stitching and deep security policy capabilities to meet even the most stringent industry requirements.</p><p>CloudStack will be able to manage these advanced functions via tight integration with the underlying best-of-breed network controller, while Tungsten Fabric handles the network fabric. </p><p><span><strong>The Community Adopting the Integration of Apache CloudStack and Tungsten Fabric</strong></span></p><p>A number of community members have already adopted Tungsten Fabric as part of their cloud infrastructure. We reached out to the community to hear their thoughts on the integration and how it benefits their organisation.</p><p><em>‘’The EWERK Group mainly serves organizations in system-relevant industries with regulated IT. In these industries, highly complex IT infrastructure projects place special demands on the network.
