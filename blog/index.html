thought. With the right technology stack, companies can quickly and easily
deploy a flexible and stable IaaS offering to support any business requirements,
as proIO discovered.</p><p><a href="https://www.proio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proIO</a> was founded in Frankfurt, Germany, nearly 20 years ago, as Swen Brüseke
explains. “We wanted to create a company based on holistic IT concepts,
providing support and advice from system design and creation through to smooth
day-to-day running of operations.”, said Swen Brüseke, CEO of proIO.</p><p>The company started by remotely looking after its customer’s physical servers
and data centres in both Frankfurt and Hamburg - 24/7. This has grown to the
extent that they now support thousands of physical servers.</p><p>During the last few years, customer demand has led proIO to extend its support
services with a fully managed cloud offering to become a Managed Service
Provider specialising in open-source Linux applications.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-proio2023.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><h2>А Move to CloudStack</h2><p>The company migrated its cloud to CloudStack in 2019 for a number of reasons, as
Swen explained. “We had used it for several years on various other projects, and
so we had acquired a great amount of working knowledge. This experience
demonstrated to us how easy it was to set up a proof of concept and deploy a
CloudStack-based solution. It was also much easier to keep up to date once
deployed compared to other solutions we had looked at.</p><h2>Fully Redundant Infrastructure Based on Open-Source Technologies</h2><p>Currently, more than 95% of proIO’s virtual machines are Linux based. “Our
customers are not bothered whether their operating system is open source or
not,” explained Swen. “They just want their apps to run to support their
business. We now look after all types of customers from healthcare, hotel
booking, through automotive and clothing to publishing.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-proio2023.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><br><br><p>“It’s great the way that everybody helps each other out in the community,
contributing what they can to ensure CloudStack continues to develop and refine
as a product. I would recommend CloudStack wholeheartedly to any organisation
that is looking at developing a cloud-based infrastructure.”, says Swen Brüseke,
CEO of proIO.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/case-studies">case-studies</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/future-proof-open-source-platform">Future-Proof Open-Source Platform Hosting Millions of Websites for Your.Online</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-03-08T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">March 8, 2023</time></div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/Ivet_H_Petrova" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1331984193392435200/djCqv-vM_400x400.jpg" alt="Ivet Petrova"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/Ivet_H_Petrova" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ivet Petrova</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">PMC Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/4d7d7c8f-3951-4d15-9340-b1360357d6f7"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/4d7d7c8f-3951-4d15-9340-b1360357d6f7" alt="banner.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p><a href="https://your.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your.Online</a> is a team of pioneers from all over the

customers and generates €175m in revenue with its eight brands and 600
employees.</p><p>Your.Online needed to build a centralized IaaS cloud platform for four of their
brands - Versio, Yourhosting, Savvii and Axarnet. The four companies ran on
different infrastructure platforms using technologies like VMware, RHEV, Xen
server, Virtuozzo, Proxmox, custom-built solutions and many others. This made it
extremely hard and nearly impossible to manage their infrastructure centrally
and ensure reliability and operational effectiveness.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-your-online.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><h2>Building a Centralised Platform Based on CloudStack</h2><p>Your.Online has built a centralized platform powered by CloudStack, Ceph,
TrueNAS and KVM to be utilized by all their hosting brands. The new solution
allowed the company to simplify infrastructure management and have end-to-end
visibility of the processes inside from a single pane of glass.</p><p>Your.Online uses BGP, EVPN and VXLAN with CloudStack’s Advanced networking
model. This allows them to scale networks very easily in a redundant and
high-performant way over multiple data centers. This is a built-in functionality
of CloudStack, which when combined with IPv6 support and security groups makes
for a modern and future-proof solution, on which they can continue to invest and
grow.</p><h2>Ensuring Reliability in the Long Term</h2><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/85db8d29-cf32-409b-b3b2-1d23df9f598d" width="120px" class="img_ev3q">“One of the reasons to centralize on CloudStack is to have one single point of truth about the utilization of our assets. One overview of the VMs, assets and capacity utilization. Now we can automate against one platform, and for us, the main driver to choosing CloudStack was that it is an open-source project governed by the Apache Software Foundation. We know it is a stable platform both from a technical and legal perspective. The project will be live in the next ten years, allowing us to avoid the risk associated with commercial projects - usually licensing and governance problems.”<b>- Wido den Hollander, CTO, Your.Online</b><br><br><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-your-online.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><h2>About Your.Online</h2><p>Your.Online is a leading European online services platform supporting businesses

on further optimization of their infrastructure, prolonging the use of servers
as much as possible and professionally recycling the ones that are no longer
functional. All these priorities create both business value and sustainable
impact.</p><h2>About Apache CloudStack</h2><p>Apache CloudStack is an open-source cloud management solution designed to deploy
and manage large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly
scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. CloudStack
is used by a number of service providers to offer public cloud services, and by
many companies to provide an on-premises (private) cloud offering, or as part of
a hybrid cloud solution.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/case-studies">case-studies</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/meet-apache-cloudstack-at-kubecon">Meet Apache CloudStack at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2023</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-02-10T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">February 10, 2023</time></div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/Ivet_H_Petrova" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1331984193392435200/djCqv-vM_400x400.jpg" alt="Ivet Petrova"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/Ivet_H_Petrova" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Ivet Petrova</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">PMC Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/fe5aa3f1-cd92-4cfa-a092-a595d3b9ffd4"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/fe5aa3f1-cd92-4cfa-a092-a595d3b9ffd4" alt="ACS-Kubecon.jpg" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><strong>On 18-21<sup>st</sup> April, in Amsterdam, Netherlands will take place one of the largest flagship cloud conferences globally - </strong><a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>KubeCon + Cloud NativeCon.</strong></a><p>We are excited to share that Apache CloudStack will be a silver sponsor at the event, and that community members will be representing the technology and community on the global stage.

We collaborated on a successful major release - Apache CloudStack 4.17 bringing a bunch of new capabilities and improvements, as well as created multiple new CloudStack integrations. As well as this, the community created two minor releases as part of the LTS programme.</p><p>The community also held two successful conferences, one of which being the first in-person CloudStack Collaboration Conference since the pandemic.

Now an in-place upgrade of CloudStack virtual routers can be performed with zero downtime.</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong><span>VR Live Patching</span></strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>Underpinning zero downtime upgrades is the new feature VR live patching. This feature can also be used independently of upgrades and allow CloudStack admins to apply software updates to Virtual Routers on the fly. Previously all Apache CloudStack scripts to manage the Virtual Router were stored in an ISO image and mounted during the first boot and then copied to the Virtual Router. Now the update is performed dynamically , as long as the base OS remains constant , users to not need to recreate the Virtual Router.</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><strong><span><span>IPv6 support for Isolated and VPC Networks</span></span></strong></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>IPv6 is considered a natural evolution of any system that intends to be present in computing environments in the future. The RIPE NCC, which assigns IP addresses in 76 countries to ISPs and other organizations, got its final allocation of IPv4 addresses from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in 2012.</span></span></span><br><span><span><span>Apache CloudStack already supported IPv6 for Shared Networks; now IPv6 is also supported for Isolated Networks and VPC. Users can deploy IPv6 networks where routing is currently static, allowing users to use subnets of IPv6 networks directly in CloudStack instances.</span><br><span>In this context, unlike IPv4 that relies on NAT to deliver network services to users, the Virtual Router behaves like a real router, routing IPv6 packets and allowing users to configure firewall.</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><strong><span><span>Self-service Network Improvements</span></span></strong></span></li></ul><p><span><span>Previously, the creation of Shared Networks and Private Gateways was an admin- only feature. When a user needed a Shared Network or Private Gateway, they would have to make a service request to the Service Provider or infrastructure operations team. Only after that, users could configure and use their respective resources.</span></span></p><p><span><span>With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can self-serve the creation of these resources through the UI or API with no involvement of the admin.</span></span></p><p><strong><span><span>To learn more about the remaining features introduced in the 4.17 release, read the </span><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/what-s-new-in-apache1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>release blog.</span></a></span></strong></p><p><strong><span><u><span><span>New CloudStack Integrations</span></span></u></span></strong></p><p><span><span>The community has collaborated on a new blog series named ‘CloudStack Integrations’, introducing a range of technologies with which CloudStack is integrated with and can become part of your technology stack.

Just like CCC, it was great to see new CloudStack committers and users, showing the growth of the global community.  </span></span></p><p><u><span><strong><span><span>Looking to the Future - Apache CloudStack 4.18 Release</span></span></strong></span></u></p><p><span>The community is looking forward to the upcoming 4.18 release, expected in late January 2023. Some exciting features you will be able to find in the new release are: </span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong>Edge computing (4.18) </strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the data source and end consumer. The presence of computing capabilities at the edge of the network reduces response times for applications while reducing connectivity costs. </span></span></p><p><span><span>This new feature will enable</span><span> operators to leverage CloudStack in deploying light-weight Zones in edge locations. Compared to the traditional CloudStack zones, a dehydrated zone results in resource savings on the boards - solving problems related to latency at low cost in regions poorly served by the internet network.</span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong>Tungsten SDN Fabric (4.18)</strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>Tungsten Fabric is an open-source SDN project that solves tooling complexity with the simplicity of only one networking and security tool. It is maintained by The Linux Foundation and is designed to support any cloud anywhere.  </span></span></p><p><span><span>From 4.18, Apache CloudStack users can leverage Tungsten Fabric as a Network Provider in Isolated and VPC Networks, adding this widely adopted SDN fabric to fill feature gaps in CloudStack, enhancing security and capabilities.</span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong>Autoscaling (4.18)</strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>This feature is an Apache CloudStack native solution, different from other approaches that created vendor lock-in of closed source products. From Apache CloudStack 4.18, cloud users can configure Autoscale VM Groups to dynamically scale up and down the number of Instances when the defined trigger conditions are met. </span></span></p><p><span><span>… and a lot more new capabilities, which will enable cloud operators to achieve more and manage easier their virtualisation. </span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><strong><u><span><span>At the end of the year…</span></span></u></strong></span></p><p><span>It was great to see another year of expansion of the Apache CloudStack community. We are happy to see new companies around the world adopting the technology and becoming involved in the community, whether it is through collaborations, development or keeping active on the mailing lists. In order for an open-source project to develop and be successful, people need to give back to the project - something that the Apache CloudStack community does extremely well. We are very grateful to the community’s efforts and progression in the technology, so kudos to all involved!  </span></p><p><span>New use cases are being shared, such as <a href="https://www.arsat.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARSAT</a> covering their use cases regarding cloud services in Argentinian government entities and also sharing their mid-term roadmap strategy to include the private sector in Arsat´s client portfolio. Another thing worth reflecting on is how companies who have been adopting Apache CloudStack long-term have managed to build reliable solutions and are using the technology continuously without looking for alternatives. The reason being because CloudStack is constantly expanding its supported integrations and technologies landscape, plus the amazing pace of development and new features released. Last but not least, we also see more vendors interested in both adopting CloudStack or building new solutions on top of it like <a href="https://www.apiculus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apiculus</a> and <a href="https://www.stackbill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackBill</a> for example. </span></p><p><span>We would like to say a big thank you to everyone involved in the project and look forward to collaborating at the CloudStack European User Group in May!</span></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/news">news</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/apache-cloudstack-lts-release-41720">Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.17.2.0</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-12-16T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">December 16, 2022</time></div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/rohityadavcloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/rohityadavcloud.png" alt="Rohit Yadav"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/rohityadavcloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Rohit Yadav</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">PMC Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/73240143-71f2-48f9-b80e-650df203613d"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/73240143-71f2-48f9-b80e-650df203613d" width="100%" class="img_ev3q"></a><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release-41720">Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.17.2.0<a href="#apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release-41720" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.17.2.0" title="Direct link to Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.17.2.0">​</a></h2><p>The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the release of CloudStack 4.17.2.0.</p><p>The CloudStack 4.17.2.0 release is a maintenance release as part of its 4.17.x  LTS branch and contains more than 20 fixes since the CloudStack 4.17.1.0 release.</p><p>CloudStack LTS branches are supported for 18 months and will receive updates for the first 12 months and only security updates in the last 6 months.</p><p>Apache CloudStack is an integrated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) software platform that allows users to build feature-rich public and private cloud environments.

So far, they have supported over 500 companies who have put their trust into IT projects and consulting expertise.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Describe what your use case is with CloudStack?</strong></li></ul><p>“In general, at EWERK we use Apache CloudStack as an IaaS platform for critical infrastructures in the areas of finance, health and public infrastructure. Due to the changes and new requirements in the market, especially for micro services, the use of PaaS and the Apache CloudStack Kubernetes service is becoming increasingly important. Crucial to the success is the ability to deploy all components via API or configuration management and deployment tools, such as Ansible or Terraform.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“The main advantage of Apache CloudStack is its open-source approach and the involvement of a diverse community from different countries. Everyone brings their best to the project, according to their abilities.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you?</strong> </li></ul><p>“I think it&#x27;s important to continue to form a good community and thus prepare the development of the project for the future. Furthermore, I see various topics such as network, Kubernetes and their automation as a challenge. Good integration of the many components in all areas from hypervisor to storage must be ensured.”</p><p> </p><p><span><strong>Wido den Hollander, CTO, </strong><a href="https://www.cldin.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ClouDINfra</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Wido den Hollander Is the Chief Technology Officer at ClouDINfra. He has been a part of the CloudStack community since 2012. Ever since he has contributed various parts of code like Ceph/RBD, IPv6, KVM and many other parts.</strong></p><p><strong>ClouDINfra’s mission is to build best-in-class digital infrastructures which scale. </strong><strong>The company works exclusively for a select number of large web services providers and supports a significant part of the Dutch IT infrastructure and public internet. Its end-users represent anything from small (or very big) webshops to critical infrastructure.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Describe what your use case is with CloudStack?</strong></li></ul><p>“At cloudinfra we use CloudStack for our internal private cloud where we <br>host the (web)services for our hundreds of thousands of customers. Using the KVM hypervisor with Ceph storage we are able to run a cost-effective yet reliable and scalable cloud platform.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“Being open source and governed by the ASF protects CloudStack from being influenced too much by commercial drivers and allows us to easily participate in the project.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you?</strong> </li></ul><p>“Private cloud deployments which are properly connected to deployment and orchestration tooling allow for easy use and adoption of CloudStack within a company.”</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span><strong>Kshitish Purohit, Co-Founder, </strong><a href="https://www.indiqus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>IndiQus Technologies</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Kshitish is the Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer at IndiQus.

While CloudStack handles the technical orchestration (of Compute, Storage and Networking resources), Apiculus complements that by adding layers of billing, marketing, monitoring, support and unified marketplace capabilities.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“The simplicity of setting up and managing complex network architectures, along with a community that’s deeply invested in solving real-world use cases, are what, I believe, set CloudStack apart from other orchestration platforms.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you? </strong></li></ul><p>“I see CloudStack as serving two different niches in the near future. One, as enterprises are bringing their workloads ‘back’ to their premises, CloudStack is going to play a key role, as owning and managing a CloudStack setup is much more efficient (w.r.t. manpower, costs, complexity) than other orchestrators. Two, as the future is going closer and closer to the end user (Edge, Web3 etc.), the portability of CloudStack makes it an ideal candidate to embrace cloud-native and Edge-native technologies to deliver powerful orchestration capabilities nearer to the end users.”</p><p> </p><p><span><strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, </strong><a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ShapeBlue</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Giles is the CEO and founder of ShapeBlue.

Most organisations are using CloudStack to drive either public cloud implementation or to orchestrate internally within an enterprise. As ShapeBlue is the company that provides services around CloudStack, we see our role as representing those customers in the open-source project. Secondary to that, we do use CloudStack in our own internal CI/CD environment, but that is a relatively small scale compared to most people using CloudStack.” </p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“Against other IaaS orchestration platforms, CloudStack has got two key advantages: A) Ease of deployment - whereas a lot of other platforms are incredibly complex to deploy. B) Reliability - CloudStack has been around for over a decade, it’s very stable, it’s very well-known, it’s in production use at many of the world’s largest organisations.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you? </strong></li></ul><p>“CloudStack’s scope will remain tightly defined. CloudStack does not have aspirations to become a new block storage platform or to become a container orchestrator, it’s highly defined at the level, which is the virtualised based orchestration layer. CloudStack will become increasingly reliable, increasingly easy to deploy, and effectively we hope will just become boring.”</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span><strong>Philipp Reisner, CEO, </strong><a href="https://linbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>LINBIT</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Philipp Reisner is one of the founders and CEO of LINBIT.

As CloudStack, it is OpenSource software composed out of DRBD, LINSTOR, and LVM/ZFS.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“As LINBIT&#x27;s SDS is available for multiple cloud software stacks and enterprise virtualization stacks, we have a bit of insight into multiple communities. The CloudStack community is thriving, and we see that CloudStack is heavily adopted in mid-sized deployments.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you? </strong></li></ul><p>“I expect CloudStack will find more large-scale adopters as the hype around the big competing technology cools off.”</p><p> </p><p><span><strong>Grégoire Lamodière, Founder, </strong><a href="https://cloud.dimsi.io/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>DIMSI</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Grégoire Lamodière is the Co-founder of DIMSI. Grégoire is a software architect who spends most of his time designing infrastructure applications and CRM systems, on-premise or multi-cloud based.
